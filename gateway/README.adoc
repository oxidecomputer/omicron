## Management Gateway Service

The Management Gateway Service (MGS) is the unimaginatively named gateway
between the control plane and entities on the management network. In
particular, it passes messages from the control plane to service processors
(SPs) within sleds, switches, and power shelf controllers, and it routes alert
messages from those entities to the control plane. It is used for inventory
inspection both of the rack and its subcomponents. It allows for power
management both via SPs and the lower-level Ignition subsystem. It is the
mechanism for updating components. And it is the service for routing errors
generated from SPs and Ignition.
