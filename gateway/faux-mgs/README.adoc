= Faux MGS

This directory contains a command-line application that acts like MGS. It is
intended to be a development tool for working with the SP.

== Examples

Sending the MGS discovery packet:

```
% cargo run --bin faux-mgs -- --sp '[fe80::c1d:7dff:feef:9f1d%2]:11111' discover
Ok(Discover(DiscoverResponse { sp_port: One }))
```

Asking an SP for its state (as of this writing, the state only contains the SP's
serial number):

```
% cargo run --bin faux-mgs -- --sp '[fe80::c1d:7dff:feef:9f1d%2]:11111' state
Ok(SpState(SpState { serial_number: [0, 68, 0, 26, 51, 48, 81, 17, 48, 51, 56, 55, 0, 0, 0, 0] }))
```

Attaching to the SP's usart (this forwards stdin to the SP, and prints anything
the SP sends to stdout):

```
% cargo run --bin faux-mgs -- --sp '[fe80::c1d:7dff:feef:9f1d%2]:11111' usart-attach
```
