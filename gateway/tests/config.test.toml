# will send a discovery message on each port listed in this section, collect the
# responses, and determine its location via the intersection of the names listed
# below (for all ports which returned a successful response). This process can
# fail if too few SPs respond (leaving us with 2 or more possible locations) or
# if there is a miscabling that results in an unsolvable system (e.g.,
# determination 0 reports "switch0" and determination 1 reports "switch1").

# entry for each member of `[switch.location]` above.

# TODO This section has some concessions to local testing: ultimately we will
# use a single multicast address, target port, and source port, but for now all
# three are configured on a per-port basis, which allows a single system to
# simulate a full set of ports and SPs.
