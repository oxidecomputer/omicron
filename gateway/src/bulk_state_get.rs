//! Implementation to fetch the state of all powered-on SPs, with support for
//! pagination across shorter timeouts than the overall timeout to collect all
//! state.
//!
//! The flow of this process, starting from the client(s), is below. This
//! modules comes into play at step 2.
//!
//! 1. A client requests the state of all SPs. The client provides a timeout for
//!    the overall request (or we provide a default timeout on their behalf),
//!    which specifies the point at which any SPs we believe are on but which we
//!    haven't heard from are classified as "unresponsive".
//!
//! 2. We enter [`BulkSpStateRequests::start()`].
//!    a. Ask our ignition controller for the ignition state of all SPs.
//!    b. We create a [`SpStateRequestId`] (internally a UUID) to identify this
//!       request.
//!    c. We create a set of futures that will be fulfilled with the state of
//!       all SPs. Any offline SPs will be fulfilled immediately. Any online SPs
//!       will have their states retreived via [`Communicator::get_state()`].
//!       Each of these futures is bounded by the timeout from step 1.
//!    d. Once the background task has reported a result for every SP, it enters
//!       a grace period in which the request ID from step 3 is still alive in
//!       memory and can be queried by clients, but there is no more work
//!       happening.
//!    e. Once the grace period ends, the background task purges the data
//!       associated with the request ID and exits.
//!
//! 3. We enter [`BulkSpStateRequests::get()`] with the request ID from
//!    step 2. This allows us to look up the corresponding `ResponseCollector`
//!    and wait for responses. The client endpoint is paginated, and we have the
//!    option of how (or even if) we want to return partial progress early;
//!    currently we choose to implement this via a timeout duration specified in
//!    the gateway configuration.
//!
//! 4. We wait in [`BulkSpStateRequests::get()`] until we hit one of three
//!    cases:
//!
//!    a. We've collected a partial set of responses of the size specified by
//!       the client's page limit
//!    b. We've collected at least one response, and our internal timeout for
//!       returning partial results has elapsed
//!    c. We've collected all responses
//!
//!    In any of these three cases, we return a page token to the client that
//!    includes the request ID, allowing them to fetch the next page (which
//!    enters this process at step 3). In case 4c we should _not_ send a page
//!    token, since we know we've reported the final page, but currently there's
//!    no clean way to handle this with dropshot.
//!
//!    The mechanics for this step are a little messy; see the comments in
//!    [`BulkSpStateRequests::get()`] for details.
