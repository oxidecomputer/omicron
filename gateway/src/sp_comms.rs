///    u32 ID attached to the request.
/// 3. `SpCommunicator` sends the UDP packet containing the request to the
///    target SP, and waits for a response on the channel it created in 1.
/// 4. When we receive a packet, we check:
///    a. Did it come from an IP address in our list of SP IPs?
///    b. Does it parse as a `Response`?
///    c. Is there a corresponding entry in `outstanding_requests` for this IP +
