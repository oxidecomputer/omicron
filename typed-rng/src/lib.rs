//! Typed RNGs with support for tree-based RNGs.
//!
//! ## [`TypedRng`]
//!
//! This library contains [`TypedRng`], a simple wrapper around a random number
//! generator that generates values of a particular type.
//!
//! At the moment, it only supports stateless value creation, where the
//! `Generatable::generate` method does not have access to anything other than
//! the RNG state. It may be extended in the future with the capability to pass
//! in persistent state.
//!
//! ### Tree-based RNGs
//!
//! Many RNG models are organized in a tree structure, where a parent RNG
//! generates a child RNG. The main benefit to this kind of structure is
//! stability of output: because the different child RNGs are all independent
//! of each other, making more calls to one RNG will not affect any others.
//!
//! The `TypedRng` struct provides a method to generate a new RNG from a parent
//! RNG and a seed. This is useful when you want to generate a new RNG that is
//! independent of the parent RNG, but still deterministic.
//!
//! ### Comparison with property-based testing
//!
//! In a sense, this is a very simple version of how random values are
//! generated with property-based testing, with e.g. `Arbitrary` or proptest's
//! `Strategy`.
//!
//! But with property-based tests, the goal is for small changes in the random
//! input to result in _small_ changes in the output. High-quality libraries
//! like proptest also focus on shrinking.
//!
//! With `Generatable`, the goal is for small changes in the random input (the
//! seed used to initialize the RNG) to result in _large_ changes in output.
//! (However, it is possible to delegate the bulk of the operation to a value
//! generator from a PBT framework). There is also no need for shrinking.
//!
//! Overall, this means that `Generatable` can be used in both testing and
//! production.
//!
//! ## Other functionality
//!
//! This crate also provides two additional convenience functions:
//!
//! - [`from_seed`], which generates a new RNG from a seed.
//! - [`from_parent_and_seed`], which generates a new RNG from a parent RNG and
//!   a seed.
//!
//! Both these methods are short, but more ergonomic and less prone to misuse
//! than using the underlying libraries directly.
