# `pg_config` is a utility which may be used to query for the installed
# PostgreSQL libraries, and is expected by the Omicron build to exist in
# the developer's PATH variable.
# - pkg-config, a tool for querying installed libraries.

# Packages to be installed on Helios only:
#
# - pkg, the IPS client (though likely it will just be updated)
# - build-essential: Common development tools
# - brand/omicron1/tools: Oxide's omicron1-brand Zone
