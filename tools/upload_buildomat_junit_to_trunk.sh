# We use Trunk (https://trunk.io) to track flaky tests in our suite. Trunk uses a custom CLI to
# upload JUnit XML files, but unfortunately we cannot run it in Buildomat, as it requires a secret.
#
# To work around that, we use this script to grab the JUnit XML files from all finished Buildomat
# jobs (as part of a GitHub Check Suite) and upload it. The script requires the GitHub Check Suite
# ID of the Buildomat job, and takes care of retrieving the rest of the metadata from the API.
#
# While the script is meant to be executed in a GitHub Actions workflow triggering after the
# Buildomat job (thanks to the check_suite event), it is possible to run the script locally (with a
# valid GITHUB_TOKEN, TRUNK_ORG_SLUG and TRUNK_TOKEN).
