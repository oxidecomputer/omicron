= Omicron Tools

This directory is home to a number of tools related to Omicron development.
There are some additional developer tools implemented as xtasks: Run
`cargo xtask -h` from the root of the repository for details.

NOTE: This document is intended to be an overview of the lay of the land here. The
source of truth is always the tools themselves: That said, if you notice
anything out of date, incorrect, or otherwise confusing, please file an issue
(or fix it!).

= Top-Level Directories

There are several top-level directories, including:

- `dtrace/`: a collection of dtrace scripts
- `include/`: scripts used by other scripts
- `populate/`: scripts to populate a running Omicron with useful guest images
- `reflector/`: related to `oxide-reflector-bot`
- `scrimlet/`: related to the setup of `softnpu`


= Miscellaneous Scripts

There are a fair number of scripts in the root directory, but many of them are
related to (or literally dependent on) each other.

== Dependency Management

One class of scripts is related to downloading miscellaneous dependencies. These
dependencies are not Rust dependencies, but instead various binaries depended
upon by Omicron.

Some of these dependencies are services we are using in the control plane but
didn't write ourselves (e.g., cockroachdb, clickhouse), and some are software we
wrote internally and fetch as artifacts from
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/buildomat/[buildomat] (e.g.,
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dendrite[dendrite],
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/maghemite[maghemite],
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/console[console]).

There are many scripts here related to each other, but they share some common
naming. At a high-level:

- scripts with names of the form `ci_download_*` are intended to install a
  single dependency. This typically involves installing a tarfile and unpacking
  into a known location (such as `out/` from the root of the source tree). They
  may also fetch artifacts from buildomat.  Some of these tools will verify the
  download binary against a checksum. Despite their name, these
  scripts are not exclusively used in CI (they are suggested to be run by
  developers in hint messages of other tools).
- `\*\_checksums` contain known checksums against which `ci_download_*` will
  verify a dependency when it is downloaded.
- `\*\_version` files (such as `console_version`) specify a version that is used
  by the `ci_download_*` scripts.
- scripts of the form `install_*.sh` are intended to install specific
  dependencies (or collections of dependencies) onto a development machine of
  some kind, for running or deploying Omicron. A current example is
  `install_prerequisites.sh` and the associated
   `install_{builder,runner}_prerequisites.sh` pair.  See
  xref:docs/how-to-run.adoc[] for details.


=== Updating Depedencies (Rust or otherwise)

The `update_*.sh` scripts are intended to help update the current supported
version of a specific dependency. Some of these operate on Rust dependencies
(such as https://github.com/oxidecomputer/propolis[propolis] and
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/crucible[crucible]), while others are related
to the binaries downloaded by the `ci_download_*` scripts.


== "Virtual Hardware" Management

Another class of scripts is related to the setup and teardown of "virtual
hardware", which can be useful when deploying omicron with a real sled agent.
Current examples include the `{create,destroy}_virtual_hardware.sh` pair.
See xref:docs/how-to-run.adoc[] for details.
