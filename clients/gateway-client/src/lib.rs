// We specifically want to allow consumers, such as `wicketd`, to embed
// inventory datatypes into their own APIs, rather than recreate structs.
//
// We did not add this functionality to `omicron_common` because, in the common
// case, we want to prohibit users from accidentally exposing implementation
// specific, private types. As an example, we don't want to make it trivial
// to include propolis types that may change in the Oxide public API. For
// scenarios like this, forcing the user of a client API to generate a new type
// serves as a safety feature in the common case. The user of an underlying
// dropshot server can always choose to use this escape hatch.
//
// In this case, we choose to allow the escape hatch, because one of two
// primary consumers of MGS is wicketd, and wicketd wants to share inventory
// data, which is already in a useful format, directly with wicket for
// processing without having to perform unnecessary manipulation. In essence,
// wicketd is just proxying information for display. Furthermore, wicket
// itself is a TUI, and so it will not be forwarding these types to any public
// consumers. While MGS also has Nexus as a client, the use case is fairly
// constrained and it is unlikely we'd desire to expose MGS types directly. In
// this instance we'll want to be extra careful, but we shouldn't burden ourself
// unduly here to prevent an unlikely mistake.
//
// If the format of inventory data desired by wicket or nexus changes such that
// it is no longer useful to directly expose the JsonSchema types, we can go
// back to reusing `omicron_common`.
//
// As another alternative, since the `derives` and `patch` directives were
// introduced, these types have moved to living in gateway-types. This means
// that we can choose to use `replace` on them. That hasn't felt necessary so
// far, but it's an option if it becomes desirable in the future. (One reason
// to do that might be that currently, `nexus-types` depends on
// `gateway-client`. Generally we expect the `-client` layer to depend on the
// `-types` layer to avoid a circular dependency, and we've had to resolve a
// rather thorny one between Nexus and sled-agent. But Nexus and sled-agent
// call into each other. Since `gateway` is a lower-level service and never
// calls into Nexus, the current scheme is okay.)
