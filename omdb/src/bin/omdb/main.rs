//! CLI for debugging Omicron internal state
//!
//! GROUND RULES:
//!
//! 1. There aren't a lot of ground rules here.  At least for now, this is a
//!    place to put any kind of runtime tooling for Omicron that seems useful.
//!    You can query the database directly (see notes in db.rs), use internal
//!    APIs, etc.  To the degree that we can stick to stable interfaces, great.
//!    But at this stage we'd rather have tools that work on latest than not
//!    have them because we couldn't prioritize keeping them stable.
//!
//! 2. Where possible, when the tool encounters something unexpected, it should
//!    print what it can (including the error message and bad data) and then
//!    continue.  It generally shouldn't stop on the first error.  (We often
//!    find strange things when debugging but we need our tools to tell us as
//!    much as they can!)
