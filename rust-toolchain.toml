# We use nightly for the "asm" unstable Rust feature, used within Propolis for
# dtrace probes.
#
# We specify a specific, known-good nightly to avoid regular breakage.
# Once all unstable features that we use are stabilized, we should switch back
# to "stable".

[toolchain]
# NOTE: This toolchain is also specified within .github/buildomat/jobs/{build-and-test,package}.sh.
# If you update it here, update that file too.
