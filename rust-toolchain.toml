#
# We use nightly for a few unstable features:
#
# 1. the "asm" unstable Rust feature, used within Propolis for dtrace probes
# 2. the "extra-link-arg" unstable Cargo feature, used in omicron-rpaths.  This
#    will be stable in 1.56.
#
# We specify a specific, known-good nightly to avoid regular breakage.
# Once the above features stabilize, we should switch back to "stable".
#

[toolchain]
# NOTE: This toolchain is also specified within .github/workflows/rust.yml
# If you update it here, update that file too.
