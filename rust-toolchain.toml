[toolchain]
# We choose a specific toolchain (rather than "stable") for repeatability.  The
# intent is to keep this up-to-date with recently-released stable Rust.
#
# NOTE: Rust 1.82 has a large compile time regression in Diesel-generated
# code: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/132064. Before moving to a
# newer Rust, ensure that the regression is addressed and that nexus-db-queries
# and omicron-nexus don't take much longer to compile!
