# We use nightly to enable the "asm" feature for dtrace probes.
#
# Additionally, we specify this specific verion of nightly to
# workaround known bugs for illumos on more recent versions.
# Context: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85772
#
# Short-term: Once that bug is fixed, we should feel free
# to update to migrate to a more recent nightly.
#
# Long-term: Once the ASM feature is stabilized, we should
# consider using stable instead of nightly.

[toolchain]
# NOTE: This toolchain is also specified within .github/workflows/rust.yml
# If you update it here, update that file too.
