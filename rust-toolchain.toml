[toolchain]
# NOTE: This toolchain is also specified in various jobs in
# .github/buildomat/jobs/.  If you update it here, update those files too.
#
# We choose a specific toolchain (rather than "stable") for repeatability.  The
# intent is to keep this up-to-date with recently-released stable Rust.
#
# Right now, we skip 1.67 due to rust-lang/cargo#11629.  There are workarounds
# for that but it's simpler to just skip this release.
