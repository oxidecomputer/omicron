# We use nightly for two reasons:
#
# 1. To enable the "asm" feature for dtrace probes.
# 2. To make use of our workaround for issue sgrif/pq-sys#36.  This relies on a
#    Cargo feature that will not be available on stable until 1.56.
#
# When both of those are part of stable Rust, we should update this file to
# point to "stable" instead.
#
# We use "nightly-2021-09-03" specifically because we know it's new enough for
# the Cargo feature required for the sgrif/pq-sys#36 workaround.  Newer
# nightlies should be fine as well.
#

[toolchain]
# NOTE: This toolchain is also specified within .github/workflows/rust.yml
# If you update it here, update that file too.
