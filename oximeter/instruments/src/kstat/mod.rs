//! Types for publishing kernel statistics via oximeter.
//!
//! # illumos kernel statistics
//!
//! illumos defines a generic framework for tracking statistics throughout the
//! OS, called `kstat`. These statistics are generally defined by the kernel or
//! device drivers, and made available to userspace for reading through
//! `libkstat`.
//!
//! Kernel statistics are defined by a 4-tuple of names, canonically separated
//! with a ":". For example, the `cpu:0:vm:pgin` kstat tracks the number of
//! memory pages paged in for CPU 0. In this case, the kstat is tracked by a
//! u64, though several data types are supported.
//!
//! This module uses the `kstat-rs` crate, which is a fairly low-level wrapper
//! around `libkstat`. For the purposes of this module, most folks will be
//! interested in the types [`kstat_rs::Kstat`], [`kstat_rs::Data`], and
//! [`kstat_rs::NamedData`].
//!
//! # Oximeter
//!
//! Oximeter is the Oxide control plane component which collects telemetry from
//! other parts of the system, called _producers_. Statistics are defined using
//! a _target_, which is an object about which statistics are collected, and
//! _metrics_, which are the actual measurements about a target. As an example,
//! a target might be an NVMe drive on the rack, and a metric might be its
//! temperature, or the estimated remaining drive lifetime.
//!
//! Targets and metrics are encapsulated by traits of the same name. Using
//! these, producers can generate timestamped [`Sample`]s, which the `oximeter`
//! collector program pulls at regular intervals for storage in the timeseries
//! database.
//!
//! # What does this mod do?
//!
//! This module is intended to connect illumos kstats with oximeter. Developers
//! can use this to define a mapping betweeen one or more kstats, and an
//! oximeter `Target` and `Metric`. This mapping is encapsulated in the
//! [`KstatTarget`] trait, which extends the `Target` trait itself.
//!
//! To implement the trait, developers register their interest in a particular
//! [`Kstat`] through the [`KstatTarget::interested()`] method. They then
//! describe how to generate any number of [`Sample`]s from that set of kstats,
//! through the [`KstatTarget::to_samples()`] method.
//!
//! # The [`KstatSampler`]
//!
//! Most folks will instantiate a [`KstatSampler`], which manages any number of
//! tracked `KstatTarget`s. Users can register their implementation of
//! `KstatTarget` with the sampler, and it will periodically generate samples
//! from it, converting the "interesting" kstats into `Sample`s.
//!
//! # Intervals and expiration
//!
//! When users register a target for sampling, they are required to include
//! details about how often their target should be sampled, and what to do if we
//! cannot produce samples due to an error, or if there are _no kstats_ that the
//! target is interested in. These details are captured in the
//! [`CollectionDetails`] type.
//!
//! After a configurable period of errors (expressed in either consecutive error
//! counts or a duration of concecutive errors), a target is _expired_, and will
//! no longer be collected from. A target's status may be queried with the
//! [`KstatSampler::target_status()`] method, which will inform the caller if
//! the target has expired. In this case, users can re-register a target, which
//! will replace the expired one, generating new samples (assuming the error
//! condition has been resolved).
