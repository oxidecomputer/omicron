// paginate the results of OxQL queries, so we need to find other ways to avoid
// DOS attacks due to large query results.
//
// While we also apply limits on the total number of samples fetched from the
// ClickHouse database, this alone is insufficient. For example, suppose we have
// two samples, spaced 1 second apart, which are then passed to an alignment
// table operation with a period of 1 nanosecond. Now you have a billion points!
//
// To prevent this, we restrict the total amount by which any alignment
// operation can upsample the data. Another way to think of it is that this
// limits the ratio between the requested period and the largest interval
// between timestamps in the data.
