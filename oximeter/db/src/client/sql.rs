//! Client methods for running SQL queries againts timeseries themselves.
//!
//! This implements a prototype system for creating "virtual tables" from each
//! timeseries, letting us run SQL queries directly against them. These tables
//! are constructed via huge joins, which effectively reconstruct the entire
//! history of samples as received from the producers. Each row is the original
//! sample. This denormalization comes at a big cost, both in cycles and memory
//! usage, since we need to build the entire join in ClickHouse and send it all
//! to the client for deserialization.
//!
//! Thus this prototype is very useful for development, running analyses on
//! small datasets. It's less helpful on real deployments, where the size of
//! data makes this approach prohibitive.
