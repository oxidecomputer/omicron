//! Low-level native client to the ClickHouse database.
//!
//! The ClickHouse server offers a number of client interfaces. We continue to
//! use JSON-over-HTTP today, because it's so easy. The server communicates with
//! the official client using what they call the "Native" protocol over TCP
//! sockets. This module implements a prototype client able to speak this
//! protocol directly.
//!
//! # Rationale
//!
//! For a long time, we've made do by talking to ClickHouse over HTTP, and
//! transferring data as JSON rows. This works, but has a number of drawbacks.
//! It incurs a lot of serialization overhead, both for the client and the
//! server. JSON is pretty verbose, and the server also needs to do a lot of
//! work to convert the native columnar formats into row-based outputs. All of
//! that goes away with the native protocol, where both peers can do little more
//! than memcpy the columns over the network.
//!
//! The HTTP interface also incurs a ot of additional _latency_. We ask the
//! server to send us metadata about the resource usage of each SQL query, such
//! as the number of rows read or written. This comes in an HTTP header, which
//! must be at the beginning of the HTTP response. However, ClickHouse normally
//! accrues these progress measures throughout a query, not just at the end. By
//! default, ClickHouse will send the first of these only! Since that's not very
//! useful for us, we ask the server to buffer the entire response, _then_ send
//! the progress metadata, and then the response itself. That means we don't get
//! any bytes from the server until it's completely done.
//!
//! Lastly, the JSON-based protocol works pretty well for inserting and
//! selecting data straight from the tables themselves. This uses the existing
//! model types in `oximeter_db::model`, which we annotate with
//! `#[serde::Serialize]` so that we can call `serde_json::to_string()` on those
//! structs. However, that only works when the data we get from the server has a
//! format or schema known at compile-time. That's not the case for OxQL, where
//! we'd like to continue to push as much of the query as possible into the
//! database. That means we need to have a dynamically-typed response. We
//! _could_ use JSON values themselves for that, but it's a good bit of work to
//! handle and we still haven't addressed the resource consumption issues.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! The ClickHouse native protocol has a very bare-bones "spec", described
//! starting [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/native-protocol/basics). The
//! client and server exchange "packets" with each other: for example, the
//! exchange starts with both sides sending a "Hello" packet, which includes the
//! peer's name and basic metadata.
//!
//! The protocol is described in detail
//! [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/98a2c1c638c2ff9cea36e68c9ac16b3cf142387b/src/Core/Protocol.h#L11)
//! as well, though be aware that certain pieces of it are missing details or
//! incorrect. The source is is always the ultimate arbiter, and packet captures
//! can aid better understanding the format.
//!
//! The client may also initiate queries or send data in special packets. The
//! server responds to queries with "Data" packets, but has a number of other
//! [kinds](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/native-protocol/server) as well. We
//! don't implement all these here, just those that we need as we go along.
//!
//! Packets are identified by a single byte at the start. (Technically, it's a
//! variable-length u64 encoding, but all the extant packets fit in the first
//! byte.) There is _no length_ included in the packets, or any other
//! fixed-length header. This presents a number of frustrating challenges for
//! serialization, but they're mostly invisible outside this module.
//!
//! ## Packet requests and responses
//!
//! ## Hello
//!
//! Exchanges begin with a Hello packet from the client. The server responds
//! with its own Hello packet.
//!
//! ## Ping / pong
//!
//! The client may ping the server by sending a Ping packet. The server responds
//! with Pong. Neither has any data, so consists of just a single byte.
//!
//! ## Queries
//!
//! A client may sent a Query packet to run a query. Note that the data for
//! INSERT queries is _not_ expected to be included in the query packet itself,
//! but in a following Data packet.
//!
//! The server responds with several kinds of packets.
//!
//! - First, the server sends an _empty_ Data packet. This describes the format
//! of the data to come, such as column names and types.
//!
//! - The server then sends zero or more non-empty Data packets, which contains
//! the actual results of the query. This structure matches the first, empty
//! packet.
//!
//! - During processing, the server may send Progress packets. These include the
//! amount of data read / written so far, and are _deltas_. They are accumulated
//! during a query, and their final sum is returned.
//!
//! - The server may send an Exception packet if something fails. This may
//! include one or more actual exceptions, each of which has code, message, and
//! stack trace. The query ends if one is received.
//!
//! - The server also sends two kinds of profiling packets. A ProfileInfo packet
//! contains basic information about the amount of data returned in the results.
//! For example, this contains the total number of rows the query processed,
//! which may be more than were actually sent. At the end, a ProfileEvents
//! packet is also sent. This is actually a Data block, which contains lots of
//! details about the resource consumption during the query, such as maximum
//! memory consumption, or number of readers-writer locks acquired.
//!
//! - The query ends when an EndOfStream packet has been received from the
//! server (or an exception).
//!
//! ## Canceling
//!
//! A query can be canceled by sending a Cancel client packet. This is only
//! actually sent if we believe we have an outstanding query.
