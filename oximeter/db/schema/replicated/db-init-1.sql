/* We purposefully split our DB schema into two *disjoint* files:
 * `db-init-1.sql` and `db-init-2.sql`. The purpose of this split is to shorten
 * the duration of our replicated tests. These tests only use a subset of the
 * tables defined in the full schema. We put the tables used by the replicated
 * tests in `db-init-1.sql`, and the remainder of the tables in `db-init-2.sql`.
 * This minimizes test time by reducing the cost to load a schema. In
 * production, we load `db-init-1.sql` followed by `db-init-2.sql` so we have
 * the full schema. If we end up needing to use more tables in replicated tests
 * we can go  ahead and move them into `db-init-1.sql`, removing them from
 * `db-init-2.sql`. Conversely, if we stop using given tables in our tests we
 * can move them from `db-init-1.sql` into `db-init-2.sql` and keep our test
 * times minimal.

 * The reason to keep the two files disjoint is so that we don't have to
 * maintain consistency between table definitions. All tables are defined
 * once. However, in order to write a test that ensures the tables are in fact
 * disjoint, we must create the `oximeter` database in both files so we can load
 * them in isolation.

 * this behavior **must not** be relied upon for query correctness.
 *
 * The index for the fields differs from the measurements, however. Rows are
 * sorted by timeseries name, then field name, field value, and finally
 * timeseries key. This reflects the most common pattern for looking them up:
 * by field name and possibly value, within a timeseries. The resulting keys are
 * usually then used to look up measurements.
 *
 * NOTE: We may want to consider a secondary index on these tables, sorting by
 * timeseries name and then key, since it would improve lookups where one
 * already has the key. Realistically though, these tables are quite small and
 * so performance benefits will be low in absolute terms.
