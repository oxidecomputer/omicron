 * Important CockroachDB notes:
 *
 *    For timestamps, CockroachDB's docs recommend TIMESTAMPTZ rather than
 *    TIMESTAMP.  This does not change what is stored with each datum, but
 *    rather how it's interpreted when clients use it.  It should make no
 *    difference to us, so we stick with the recommendation.
 *
 *    We avoid explicit foreign keys due to this warning from the docs: "Foreign
 *    key dependencies can significantly impact query performance, as queries
 *    involving tables with foreign keys, or tables referenced by foreign keys,
 *    require CockroachDB to check two separate tables. We recommend using them
 *    sparingly."

 * this role on a particular Project is granted various read-only permissions on
 * that Project.  The specific permissions associated with the role are defined
 * in Omicron's Polar (Oso) policy file.
 *
 * A built-in role like "project.viewer" has four parts:
 *
 * * resource type: "project"
 * * role name: "viewer"
 * * full name: "project.viewer"
 * * description: "Project Viewer"
 *
 * Internally, we can treat the tuple (resource type, role name) as a composite
 * primary key.  Externally, we expose this as the full name.  This is
 * consistent with RFD 43 and other IAM systems.
 *
 * These fields look awfully close to the identity metadata that we use for most
 * other tables.  But they're just different enough that we can't use most of
 * the same abstractions:
 *
 * * "id": We have no need for a uuid because the (resource_type, role_name) is
 *   already unique and immutable.
 * * "name": What we call "full name" above could instead be called "name",
 *   which would be consistent with other identity metadata.  But it's not a
 *   legal "name" because of the period, and it would be confusing to have
 *   "resource type", "role name", and "name".
 * * "time_created": not that useful because it's whenever the system was
 *   initialized, and we have plenty of other timestamps for that
 * * "time_modified": does not apply because the role cannot be changed
 * * "time_deleted" does not apply because the role cannot be deleted
 *
 * If the set of roles and their permissions are fixed, why store them in the
 * database at all?  Because what's dynamic is the assignment of roles to users.
 * We have a separate table that says "user U has role ROLE on resource
 * RESOURCE".  How do we represent the ROLE part of this association?  We use a
 * foreign key into this "role_builtin" table.

/*
 * Hardware/software inventory
 *
 * See RFD 433 for details.  Here are the highlights.
 *
 * Omicron periodically collects hardware/software inventory data from the
 * running system and stores it into the database.  Each discrete set of data is
 * called a **collection**.  Each collection contains lots of different kinds of
 * data, so there are many tables here.  For clarity, these tables are prefixed
 * with:
 *
 *     `inv_*` (examples: `inv_collection`, `inv_service_processor`)
 *
 *         Describes the complete set of hardware and software in the system.
 *         Rows in these tables are immutable, but they describe mutable facts
 *         about hardware and software (e.g., the slot that a disk is in).  When
 *         these facts change (e.g., a disk moves between slots), a new set of
 *         records is written.
 *
 * All rows in the `inv_*` tables point back to a particular collection.  They
 * represent the state observed at some particular time.  Generally, if two
 * observations came from two different places, they're not put into the same
 * row of the same table.  For example, caboose information comes from the SP,
 * but it doesn't go into the `inv_service_processor` table.  It goes in a
 * separate `inv_caboose` table.  This is debatable but it preserves a clearer
 * record of exactly what information came from where, since the separate record
 * has its own "source" and "time_collected".
 *
 * Information about service processors and roots of trust are joined with
 * information reported by sled agents via the baseboard id.
 *
 * Hardware and software identifiers are normalized for the usual database
 * design reasons.  This means instead of storing hardware and software
 * identifiers directly in the `inv_*` tables, these tables instead store
 * foreign keys into one of these groups of tables, whose names are also
 * prefixed for clarity:
 *
 *     `hw_*` (example: `hw_baseboard_id`)
 *
 *         Maps hardware-provided identifiers to UUIDs that are used as foreign
 *         keys in the rest of the schema. (Avoids embedding these identifiers
 *         into all the other tables.)
 *
 *     `sw_*` (example: `sw_caboose`)
 *
 *         Maps software-provided identifiers to UUIDs that are used as foreign
 *         keys in the rest of the schema. (Avoids embedding these identifiers
 *         into all the other tables.)
 *
 * Records in these tables are shared across potentially many collections.  To
 * see why this is useful, consider that `sw_caboose` records contain several
 * long identifiers (e.g., git commit, SHA sums) and in practice, most of the
 * time, we expect that all components of a given type will have the exact same
 * cabooses.  Rather than store the caboose contents in each
 * `inv_service_processor` row (for example), often replicating the exact same
 * contents for each SP for each collection, these rows just have pointers into
 * the `sw_caboose` table that stores this data once.  (This also makes it much
 * easier to determine that these components _do_ have the same cabooses.)
 *
 * On PC systems (i.e., non-Oxide hardware), most of these tables will be empty
 * because we do not support hardware inventory on these systems.
 *
 * Again, see RFD 433 for more on all this.

/*
 * System-level blueprints
 *
 * See RFD 457 and 459 for context.
 *
 * A blueprint describes a potential system configuration. The primary table is
 * the `blueprint` table, which stores only a small amount of metadata about the
 * blueprint. The bulk of the information is stored in the `bp_*` tables below,
 * each of which references back to `blueprint` by ID.
 *
 * `bp_target` describes the "target blueprints" of the system. Insertion must
 * follow a strict set of rules:
 *
 * * The first target blueprint must have version=1, and must have no parent
 *   blueprint.
 * * The Nth target blueprint must have version=N, and its parent blueprint must
 *   be the blueprint that was the target at version=N-1.
 *
 * The result is that the current target blueprint can always be found by
 * looking at the maximally-versioned row in `bp_target`, and there is a linear
 * history from that blueprint all the way back to the version=1 blueprint. We
 * will eventually prune old blueprint targets, so it will not always be
 * possible to view the entire history.
 *
 * `bp_sled_omicron_zones`, `bp_omicron_zone`, and `bp_omicron_zone_nic` are
 * nearly identical to their `inv_*` counterparts, and record the
 * `OmicronZonesConfig` for each sled.
