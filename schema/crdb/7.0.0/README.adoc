This upgrade turns VMM processes into first-class objects in the Omicron data
model. Instead of storing an instance's runtime state entirely in the Instance
table, Nexus stores per-VMM state and uses an Instance's active_propolis_id to
determine which VMM (if any) holds the instance's current runtime state. This
makes it much easier for Nexus to reason about the lifecycles of Propolis jobs
and their resource requirements.

In this scheme:

* Sled assignments and Propolis server IPs are tracked per-VMM.
* An instance may not have an active VMM at all. In that case its own `state`
  column supplies the instance's logical state.
* An instance's two generation numbers (one for the reported instance state and
  one for its Propolis IDs) are once again collapsed into a single number.
