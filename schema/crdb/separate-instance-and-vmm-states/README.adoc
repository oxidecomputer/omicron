# Overview

This schema change splits the "instance state" enum that instances and VMMs
share into two enums, one for instance states and one for VMM states. Variants
used by only one of these objects only appear in the corresponding enum. This
upgrade also adds a database-level constraint that requires that an instance's
state reports that it has an active VMM if and only if it has an active Propolis
ID.

This change is mechanically tricky for two reasons. First, the states instances
and VMMs have after an upgrade depends on the state that they have before the
upgrade. (While this upgrade is supposed to take place offline, past experience
with instances that are stuck in a non-Stopped state shows that we can't take
for granted that all instances and VMMs will be Stopped at upgrade time.)
Second, Postgres and/or CRDB don't support all the schema change primitives we
might use to deprecate the old state column. Specifically:

* CockroachDB doesn't support altering column types without enabling an
  experimental flag
  (see https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/49329?version=v22.1).
* Postgres doesn't support removing enum variants (adding and renaming are OK),
  so we can't shrink and directly reuse the existing instance state enum without
  leaving a set of "reserved"/"unused" variants around.
* Even if it did, Postgres doesn't support the `IF EXISTS` qualifier for many
  `ALTER TYPE` and `ALTER TABLE` statements, e.g. `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN`
  and `ALTER TYPE RENAME TO`. There are ways to work around this (e.g. put the
  statement into a user-defined function or code block and catch the relevant
  exceptions from it), but CockroachDB v22.1.9 doesn't support UDFs (support
  was added in v22.2).

These limitations make it hard to change the schema idempotently. To get around
this, the change uses the following general procedure to change a column's type
from one enum to another:

. Create a new enum with the variants of interest.
. Create a new temporary column to hold the old object state. (Adding a column
  supports `IF NOT EXISTS`).
. Copy the old object state to the temporary column.
. Drop the old column (this supports `IF EXISTS`).
. Recreate the state column with the new type.
. Populate the column's values using the data saved in the temporary column.
. Add a `NOT NULL` qualifier to the new column.
. Drop the temporary column.

Note that deleting and recreating columns this way (instead of modfying them in
place) changes their column indices in the affected table. These columns need to
be moved to the (current) ends of the table definitions in dbinit.sql, or the
schema upgrade tests will fail.

# Upgrade steps

The individual transactions in this upgrade do the following:

* `up01` and `up02` drop views that depend on the `state` column in the `vmm`
  table.
* `up03` through `up10` change the `instance` table's state enum using the
  procedure described above.
* `up11` through `up18` upgrade the `vmm` table.
* `up19` and `up21` recreate the views deleted at the beginning of this
  procedure.
* `up20` deletes the now-unused `instance_state` enum.
* `up22` adds a constraint to the `instance` table that requires that an
  instance be in the `vmm` state if and only if it has a non-NULL active
  Propolis ID.
