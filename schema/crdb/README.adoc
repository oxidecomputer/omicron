= Database Schemas

This directory describes the schema(s) used by CockroachDB.

We use the following conventions:

* `schema/crdb/VERSION/up.sql`: The necessary idempotent migrations to transition from the
  previous version of CockroachDB to this version.
* `schema/crdb/dbinit.sql`: The necessary operations to create the latest version
  of the schema. Should be equivalent to running all `up.sql` migrations, in-order.
* `schema/crdb/dbwipe.sql`: The necessary operations to delete the latest version
  of the schema.

Note that to upgrade from version N to version N+2, we always need to apply the
N+1 upgrade first, before applying the N+2 upgrade. This simplifies our model
of DB schema changes as an incremental linear history.

== Offline Upgrade

Nexus currently supports **offline** schema migrations.
This means we're operating with the following constraints:

* We assume that downtime is acceptable to perform an update.
* We assume that while an update is occuring, all Nexus services
are running the same version of software.
* We assume that no (non-upgrade) concurrent database requests will happen for
the duration of the migration.

This is not an acceptable long-term solution - we must be able to update
without downtime - but it is an interim solution, and one which provides a
fall-back pathway for performing upgrades.

See RFD 319 for more discussion of the online upgrade plans.

=== How to change the schema

Assumptions:

* The (previously) latest schema version is referred to as `OLD_VERSION`
* Your new changes will bring the schema to a new version, `NEW_VERSION`

Process:

* Choose a `NEW_VERSION` number. This should almost certainly be a major version bump over `OLD_VERSION`.
* Add a file to `schema/crdb/NEW_VERSION/up.sql` with your changes to the schema.
** This file should validate the expected current version transactionally.
** This file should only issue a single schema-modifying statement per transaction.
** This file should not issue any data-modifying operations within the schema-modifying transactions.
* Update `schema/crdb/dbinit.sql` to match what the database should look like
  after your update is applied. Don't forget to update the version field of
  `db_metadata` at the bottom of the file!
** If necessary, do the same thing for `schema/crdb/dbwipe.sql`.
* Update Nexus's idea of the latest schema, by updating it's `SCHEMA_VERSION` to
  `NEW_VERSION` within `nexus/db-model/src/schema.rs`.

SQL Validation, via Automated Tests:

* The `SCHEMA_VERSION` matches the version used in `dbinit.sql`
* The combination of all `up.sql` files results in the same schema as `dbinit.sql`
* All `up.sql` files can be applied twice without error
