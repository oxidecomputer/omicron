= Database Schemas

This directory describes the schema(s) used by CockroachDB.

We use the following conventions:

* `schema/crdb/VERSION/up*.sql`: Files containing the necessary idempotent
  statements to transition from the previous version of the database schema to
  this version.  All of the statements in a given file will be executed
  together in one transaction; however, usually only one statement should
  appear in each file.  More on this below.
** If there's only one statement required, we put it into `up.sql`.
** If more than one change is needed, any number of files starting with `up`
   and ending with `.sql` may be used. These files  must follow a
   numerically-increasing pattern starting with 1 (leading prefixes are allowed,
   so `up1.sql`, `up2.sql`, ..., or `up01.sql`, `up02.sql`, etc.), and they will
   be sorted numerically by these values.  Each will be executed in a separate
   transaction.
** CockroachDB documentation recommends the following: "Execute schema
   changes ... in an explicit transaction consisting of the single schema
   change statement.".  Practically this means: If you want to change multiple
   tables, columns, types, indices, or constraints, do so in separate files.
   See https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/online-schema-changes for
   more.
* `schema/crdb/dbinit.sql`: The necessary operations to create the latest
  version of the schema. Should be equivalent to running all `up.sql`
  migrations, in-order.
* `schema/crdb/dbwipe.sql`: The necessary operations to delete the latest
  version of the schema.

Note that to upgrade from version N to version N+2, we always apply the N+1
upgrade first, before applying the N+2 upgrade. This simplifies our model of DB
schema changes by ensuring an incremental, linear history.

== Offline Upgrade

Nexus currently supports **offline** schema migrations.
This means we're operating with the following constraints:

* We assume that downtime is acceptable to perform an update.
* We assume that while an update is occuring, all Nexus services
  are running the same version of software.
* We assume that no (non-upgrade) concurrent database requests will happen for
  the duration of the migration.

This is not an acceptable long-term solution - we must be able to update
without downtime - but it is an interim solution, and one which provides a
fall-back pathway for performing upgrades.

See RFD 319 for more discussion of the online upgrade plans.

== How to change the schema

Assumptions:

* The (previously) latest schema version is referred to as `OLD_VERSION`
* Your new changes will bring the schema to a new version, `NEW_VERSION`

Process:

* Choose a `NEW_VERSION` number. This should almost certainly be a major
  version bump over `OLD_VERSION`.
* Create directory `schema/crdb/NEW_VERSION`.
* If only one SQL statement is necessary to get from `OLD_VERSION` to
  `NEW_VERSION`, put that statement into `schema/crdb/NEW_VERSION/up.sql`.  If
  multiple statements are required, put each one into a separate file, naming
  these `schema/crdb/NEW_VERSION/upN.sql` for as many `N` as you need, staring
  with `N=1`.
** Each file should contain _either_ one schema-modifying statement _or_ some
   number of data-modifying statements.  You can combine multiple data-modifying
   statements.  But you should not mix schema-modifying statements and
   data-modifying statements in one file.  And you should not include multiple
   schema-modifying statements in one file.
** Beware that the entire file will be run in one transaction.  Expensive data-
   modifying operations leading to long-running transactions are generally
   to-be-avoided; however, there's no better way to do this today if you really
   do need to update thousands of rows as part of the update.
* Update `schema/crdb/dbinit.sql` to match what the database should look like
  after your update is applied. Don't forget to update the version field of
  `db_metadata` at the bottom of the file!
** If necessary, do the same thing for `schema/crdb/dbwipe.sql`.
* Update Nexus's idea of the latest schema, by updating its `SCHEMA_VERSION` to
  `NEW_VERSION` within `nexus/db-model/src/schema.rs`.

SQL Validation, via Automated Tests:

* The `SCHEMA_VERSION` matches the version used in `dbinit.sql`
* The combination of all `up.sql` files results in the same schema as
  `dbinit.sql`
* All `up.sql` files can be applied twice without error

=== General notes

CockroachDB's representation of the schema includes some opaque
internally-generated fields that are order dependent, like the names of
anonymous CHECK constraints.  Our schema comparison tools intentionally ignore
these values. As a result, when performing schema changes, the order of new
tables and constraints should generally not be important.

As convention, however, we recommend keeping the `db_metadata` file at the end
of `dbinit.sql`, so that the database does not contain a version until it is
fully populated.

=== Scenario-specific gotchas

==== Renaming columns

Idempotently renaming existing columns is unfortunately not possible in our
current database configuration. (Postgres doesn't support the use of an `IF
EXISTS` qualifier on an `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` statement, and the version
of CockroachDB we use at this writing doesn't support the use of user-defined
functions as a workaround.)

An (imperfect) workaround is to use the `#[diesel(column_name = foo)]` attribute
in Rust code to preserve the existing name of a column in the database while
giving its corresponding struct field a different, more meaningful name.
