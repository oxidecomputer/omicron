This migration changes the schema for ereports so that, rather than storing
host OS and service processor ereports in separate `host_ereport` and
`sp_ereport` tables, we instead store all ereports in a single `ereport` table.

In particular, we:

. Create the `ereporter_type` enum, which identifies whether an
  ereport came from an SP or the host OS (`up01.sql`)
. Create the `ereport` table (`up02.sql`)
. Insert every non-deleted entry from the `sp_ereport` and `host_ereport`
  tables into the new table (`up03.sql`)
. Create a bunch of indices on the new table (`up04.sql`, `up05.sql`,
  `up06.sql`, `up07.sql`)
. Drop the old tables (`up08.sql`, `up09.sql`)
