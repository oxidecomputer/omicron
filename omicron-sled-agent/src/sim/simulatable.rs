/**
 * Describes Oxide API objects that can be simulated here in the sled agent
 *
 * We only simulate these objects from the perspective of an API consumer, which
 * means for example accepting a request to boot it, reporting the current state
 * as "starting", and then some time later reporting that the state is
 * "running".
 *
 * This interface defines only associated functions, not constructors nor what
 * would traditionally be called "methods".  On the one hand, this approach is
 * relatively simple to reason about, since all the functions are stateless.  On
 * the other hand, the interface is a little gnarly.  That's largely because
 * this plugs into a more complex simulation mechanism (implemented by
 * `SimObject` and `SimCollection`) and this interface defines only the small
 * chunks of functionality that differ between types.  Still, this is cleaner
 * than what was here before!
 *
 * The basic idea is that for any type that we want to simulate (e.g.,
 * Instances), there's a `CurrentState` (which you could think of as "stopped",
 * "starting", "running", "stopping") and a `RequestedState` (which would only
 * be "stopped" and "running" -- you can't ask an Instance to transition to
 * "starting" or "stopping")
 *
 * (The term "state" here is a bit overloaded.  `CurrentState` refers to the
 * state of the object itself that's being simulated.  This might be an Instance
 * that is currently in state "running".  `RequestedState` refers to a requested
 * _change_ to the state of the object.  The state of the _simulated_ object
 * includes both of these: e.g., a "starting" Instance that is requested to be
 * "running".  So in most cases in the interface below, the state is represented
 * by a tuple of `(CurrentState, Option<RequestedState>)`.)
 *
 * Transitioning between states is always either synchronous (which means that
 * we make the transition immediately) or asynchronous (which means that we
 * first transition to some intermediate state and some time later finish the
 * transition to the requested state).  An Instance transition from "Stopped" to
 * "Destroyed" is synchronous.  An Instance transition from "Stopped" to
 * "Running" is asynchronous; it first goes to "Starting" and some time later
 * becomes "Running".
 *
 * It's expected that an object can begin another user-requested state
 * transition no matter what state it's in, although some particular transitions
 * may be disallowed (e.g., "reboot" from a stopped state).
 *
 * The implementor determines the set of possible states (via `CurrentState` and
 * `RequestedState`) as well as what transitions are allowed (via
 * `next_state_for_new_target()`).
 *
 * When an asynchronous state change completes, we notify the control plane via
 * the `notify()` function.
 */
/*
 * TODO-cleanup Among the awkward bits here is that the an object's state is
 * essentially represented by a tuple `(CurrentState, Option<RequestedState>)`,
 * but that's not represented anywhere.  Would it help to have that be a
 * first-class type?  Maybe it would be easier if there were a separate type
 * representing pairs of possible values here?  That sounds worse (because it
 * sounds MxN), but in practice many combinations are not legal and so it might
 * eliminate code that checks for these cases.
