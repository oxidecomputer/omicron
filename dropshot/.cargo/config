# Override the rustdoc flags that are set for the parent crate in this
# workspace.  (This is kind of an unfortunate way to do this -- all we really
# want to do here is to turn off --document-private-items so that this crate
# gets documented like a normal library crate.  However, the only way we can do
# this is to remove all configured rustdoc flags.)
