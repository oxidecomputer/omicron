/*!
 * Interface for implementing HTTP endpoint handler functions.
 *
 * For information about supported endpoint function signatures, argument types,
 * extractors, and return types, see the top-level documentation for this crate.
 * As documented there, we support several different sets of function arguments
 * and return types.
 *
 * We allow for variation in the function arguments not so much for programmer
 * convenience (since parsing the query string or JSON body could be implemented
 * in a line or two of code each, with the right helper functions) but rather so
 * that the type signature of the handler function can be programmatically
 * analyzed to generate an OpenAPI snippet for this endpoint.  This approach of
 * treating the server implementation as the source of truth for the API
 * specification ensures that--at least in many important ways--the
 * implementation cannot diverge from the spec.
 *
 * Just like we want API input types to be represented in function arguments, we
 * want API response types to be represented in function return values so that
 * OpenAPI tooling can identify them at build time.  The more specific a type
 * returned by the handler function, the more can be validated at build-time,
 * and the more specific an OpenAPI schema can be generated from the source
 * alone.
 *
 * We go through considerable effort below to make this interface possible.
 * Both the interface (primarily) and the implementation (less so) are inspired
 * by Actix-Web.  The Actix implementation is significantly more general (and
 * commensurately complex).  It would be possible to implement richer facilities
 * here, like extractors for backend server state, headers, and so on; allowing
 * for server and request parameters to be omitted; and so on; but those other
 * facilities don't seem that valuable right now since they largely don't affect
 * the OpenAPI spec.

 * etc., but the implementations are almost identical.
 */
/*
 * For background: as the module-level documentation explains, we want to
 * support API endpoint handler functions that vary in their signature so that
 * the signature can accurately reflect details about their expected input and
 * output instead of a generic `Request -> Response` description.  The
 * `HttpHandlerFunc` trait defines an interface for invoking one of these
 * functions.  This macro defines an implementation of `HttpHandlerFunc` that
 * says how to take any of these HTTP endpoint handler function and provide that
 * uniform interface for callers.  The implementation essentially does three
 * things:
 *
 * 1. Converts the uniform arguments of `handle_request()` into the appropriate
 *    arguments for the underlying function.  This is easier than it sounds at
 *    this point because we require that one of the arguments be a tuple whose
 *    types correspond to the argument types for the function, so we just need
 *    to unpack them from the tuple into function arguments.
 *
 * 2. Converts a call to the `handle_request()` method into a call to the
 *    underlying function.
 *
 * 3. Converts the return type of the underlying function into the uniform
 *    return type expected by callers of `handle_request()`.  This, too, is
 *    easier than it sounds because we require that the return value implement
 *    `Into<HttpResponseWrap>` and we have a converter from that into the final
 *    return type.
 *
 * As mentioned above, we're implementing the trait `HttpHandlerFunc` on _any_
 * type `FuncType` that matches the trait bounds below.  In particular, it must
 * take a request context argument and whatever other type parameters have been
 * passed to this macro.
 *
 * The function's return type deserves further explanation.  (Actually, these
 * functions all return a `Future`, but for convenience when we say "return
 * type" in the comments here we're referring to the output type of the returned
 * future.)  Again, as described above, we'd like to allow HTTP endpoint
 * functions to return a variety of different return types that are ultimately
 * converted into `Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>`.  To do that, the trait
 * bounds below say that the function must produce a `Result<ResponseType,
 * HttpError>` where `ResponseType` is a type that implements
 * `Into<HttpResponseWrap>`.  In turn, `Into<Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>`
 * is implemented for `HttpResponseWrap`.  This probably all sounds more
 * complicated than it needs to be.  It looks like this:
 *
 *      1. Handler function
 *            |
 *            | returns:
 *            v
 *      2. Result<ResponseType, HttpError>
 *            |
 *            | On success, this will be Ok(ResponseType) for some specific
 *            | ResponseType that provides Into<HttpResponseWrap>.  It
 *            | likely provides this by providing
 *            | Into<Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>.  We'll end up
 *            | invoking:
 *            v
 *      3. ResponseType::into<Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>>()
 *            |
 *            | This is a type-specific conversion from `ResponseType` into
 *            | `Response<Body>` that's allowed to fail with an `HttpError`.
 *            v
 *      4. Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>
 *            |
 *            | Now, for reasons explained below, we'll wind up invoking:
 *            v
 *      5. HttpResponseWrap::from<Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>>
 *            |
 *            | As the name implies, `HttpResponseWrap` just wraps the object
 *            | it's given, producing:
 *            v
 *      6. HttpResponseWrap
 *            |
 *            | Finally, we perform a conversion:
 *            v
 *      7. HttpResponseWrap::into<Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>>
 *            |
 *            | giving us what we really wanted:
 *            v
 *      8. Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>
 *
 * A fair observation might be: we already had what we wanted at step 4.  Why
 * have `HttpResponseWrap` and the extra conversions at all?  To skip that, we
 * might like to have the handler function's return type be something like
 * `Result<ResponseType, HttpError>` with `ResponseType: Into<Response<Body>>`.
 * The problem with this: the conversion from `ResponseType` to `Response<Body>`
 * is allowed to fail (with an `HttpError`, primarily because
 * `serde_json::to_string()` is allowed to fail).  Okay, so let's make it return
 * `Result<ResponseType, HttpError>` with `ResponseType:
 * Into<Result<Response<Body>>, HttpError>`.  Note that we'd have an extra level
 * of `Result` here, but that's okay.  Now comes the real problem: that means
 * we'd have to define a conversion from `Response<Body>` (an important
 * `ResponseType` to `Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>`.  That's trivial, of
 * course, but we're not allowed to do that because both `Response` and `Result`
 * are foreign to this crate.  So instead, we define conversions to our
 * intermediate type `HttpResponseWrap` and trust that the compiler optimizes
 * most of these steps away anyway.  (Another approach might be to define a
 * different implementation of `HttpHandlerFunc` for the special case of
 * functions that return `Response<Body>` and drop `ResponseType` altogether in
 * that implementation.  However, that implementation would conflict with the
 * more generic one because our two implementations would differ only in their
 * type bounds, which are not considered when determining conflicts.
 *
 * Another way to think about it is that if you just follow the trait bounds,
 * you would go straight from step 2 to step 6 via a conversion from
 * `ResponseType` into `HttpResponseWrap`.  That doesn't look so silly.  It's
 * just that in order to avoid `ResponseType` implementors having to know about
 * our extra type, we allow them to instead define conversions to
 * `Result<Response<Body>, HttpError>` and we provide our own converter from
 * that to `HttpResponseWrap` (which ends up looking silly, as shown above).
 *
 * Note: the macro parameters really ought to be `$i:literal` and `$T:ident`,
 * however that causes us to run afoul of issue dtolnay/async-trait#46. The
 * workaround is to make both parameters `tt` (token tree).
 *
 * TODO-cleanup: could this all be a lot simpler if we made callers that want to
 * use `Response<Body>` wrap it in our own type?  That'd be nice anyway because
 * we want that to be the uncommon case.  We could even generate a warning that
 * has to be gagged or something.
