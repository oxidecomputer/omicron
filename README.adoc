= Oxide Control Plane

This repo houses the work-in-progress Oxide Rack control plane.

image::https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/workflows/Rust/badge.svg[]

Omicron is open-source.  But we're pretty focused on our own goals for the foreseeable future and not able to help external contributors.  Please see xref:CONTRIBUTING.md[] for more information.

== Documentation

https://docs.oxide.computer/api[Docs are automatically generated for the public (externally-facing) API] based on the OpenAPI spec that itself is automatically generated from the server implementation.  You can generate your own docs for either the public API or any of the internal APIs by feeding the corresponding OpenAPI specs (in link:./openapi[]) into an OpenAPI doc generator.

There are some internal design docs in the link:./docs[] directory.

For more design documentation and internal Rust API docs, see the https://rust.docs.corp.oxide.computer/omicron/[generated Rust documentation].  You can generate this yourself with:

[source,text]
----
$ cargo doc --document-private-items
----

Note that `--document-private-items` is configured by default, so you can actually just use `cargo doc`.

Folks with access to Oxide RFDs may find RFD 48 ("Control Plane Requirements") and other control plane RFDs relevant.  These are not currently publicly available.

== Build and run

Omicron has two modes of operation: "simulated" and "non-simulated".

The simulated version of Omicron allows the high-level control plane logic to run without
actually managing any sled-local resources. This version can be executed on Linux, Mac, and illumos.
This mode of operation is provided for development and testing only.

To build and run the simulated version of Omicron, see: xref:docs/how-to-run-simulated.adoc[].

The non-simulated version of Omicron actually manages sled-local resources, and may only
be executed on hosts running Helios.
This mode of operation will be used in production.

To build and run the non-simulated version of Omicron, see: xref:docs/how-to-run.adoc[].

=== rustfmt and clippy

You can **format the code** using `cargo fmt`.  Make sure to run this before pushing changes.  The CI checks that the code is correctly formatted.

You can **run the https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy[Clippy linter]** using `cargo clippy --all-targets \-- --deny warnings --allow clippy::style`.  Make sure to run this before pushing changes.  The CI checks that the code is clippy-clean.

== Docker image

This repo includes a Dockerfile that builds an image containing the Nexus and sled agent.  There's a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes the Docker image.  This is used by https://github.com/oxidecomputer/cli[cli] for testing. This is **not** the way Omicron will be deployed on production systems, but it's a useful vehicle for working with it.

== Configuration reference

`nexus` requires a TOML configuration file.  There's an example in
xref:nexus/examples/config.toml[].

Supported config properties include:

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Example
|Required?
|Description

|`database.url`
|`"postgresql://root@127.0.0.1:32221/omicron?sslmode=disable"`
|Yes
|URL identifying the CockroachDB instance(s) to connect to.  CockroachDB is used for all persistent data.

|`dropshot_external`
|
|Yes
|Dropshot configuration for the external server (i.e., the one that operators and developers using the Oxide rack will use).  Specific properties are documented below, but see the Dropshot README for details. Note that this is an array of external address configurations; multiple may be supplied.

|`dropshot_external.bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port for the **external** API (i.e., the one that operators and developers using the Oxide rack will use).  In general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not (yet?) supported.

|`dropshot_external.request_body_max_bytes`
|`1000`
|Yes
|Specifies the maximum request body size for the **external** API.

|`dropshot_internal`
|
|Yes
|Dropshot configuration for the internal server (i.e., the one used by the sled agent).  Specific properties are documented below, but see the Dropshot README for details.

|`dropshot_internal.bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port for the **internal** API (i.e., the one used by the sled agent).  In general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not (yet?) supported.

|`dropshot_internal.request_body_max_bytes`
|`1000`
|Yes
|Specifies the maximum request body size for the **internal** API.

|`id`
|`"e6bff1ff-24fb-49dc-a54e-c6a350cd4d6c"`
|Yes
|Unique identifier for this Nexus instance

|`log`
|
|Yes
|Logging configuration.  Specific properties are documented below, but see the Dropshot README for details.

|`log.mode`
|`"file"`
|Yes
|Controls where server logging will go.  Valid modes are `"stderr-terminal"` and `"file".  If the mode is `"stderr-terminal"`, human-readable output, with colors and other terminal formatting if possible, will be sent to stderr.  If the mode is `"file"`, Bunyan-format output will be sent to the filesystem path given by `log.path`.  See also `log.if_exists`, which controls the behavior if the destination path already exists.

|`log.level`
|`"info"`
|Yes
|Specifies what severity of log messages should be included in the log.  Valid values include `"trace"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, and `"critical"`, which are increasing order of severity.  Log messages at the specified level and more severe levels will be included in the log.

|`log.path`
|`"logs/server.log"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property determines the path to the log file.
See also `log.if_exists`.

|`log.if_exists`
|`"append"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property specifies what to do if the destination log file already exists.  Valid values include `"append"` (which appends to the existing file), `"truncate"` (which truncates the existing file and then uses it as though it had just been created), and `"fail"` (which causes the server to exit immediately with an error).

=== Configuring ClickHouse

The ClickHouse binary uses several sources for its configuration. The binary expects an XML
config file, usually named `config.xml` to be available, or one may be specified with the
`-C` command-line flag. The binary also includes a minimal configuration _embedded_ within
it, which will be used if no configuration file is given or present in the current directory.
The server also accepts command-line flags for overriding the values of the configuration
parameters.

The packages downloaded by `ci_download_clickhouse` include a `config.xml` file with them.
You should probably run ClickHouse via the `omicron-dev` tool, but if you decide to run it
manually, you can start the server with:

[source,text]
$ /path/to/clickhouse server --config-file /path/to/config.xml

The configuration file contains a large number of parameters, but most of them are described
with comments in the included `config.xml`, or you may learn more about them
https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings/[here]
and https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/[here]. Parameters may be updated
in the `config.xml`, and the server will automatically reload them. You may also specify
many of them on the command-line with:

[source,text]
$ /path/to/clickhouse server --config-file /path/to/config.xml -- --param_name param_value ...

=== Generated Service Clients and Updating

Each service is a Dropshot server that presents an HTTP API. The description of
that API is serialized as an
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI] document which we store
in link:./openapi[`omicron/openapi`] and check in to this repo. In order to
ensure that changes to those APIs are made intentionally, each service contains
a test that validates that the current API matches. This allows us 1. to catch
accidental changes as test failures and 2. to explicitly observe API changes
during code review (and in the git history).

We also use these OpenAPI documents as the source for the clients we generate
using https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor[Progenitor]. Clients are
automatically updated when the coresponding OpenAPI document is modified.

Note that Omicron contains a nominally circular dependency:

* Nexus depends on the Sled Agent client
* The Sled Agent client is derived from the OpenAPI document emitted by Sled Agent
* Sled Agent depends on the Nexus client
* The Nexus client is derived from the OpenAPI document emitted by Nexus

We effectively "break" this circular dependency by virtue of the OpenAPI
documents being checked in.

In general, changes any service API **require the following set of build steps**:

* Make changes to the service API
* Build the package for the modified service alone. This can be done by changing
  directories there, or `cargo build -p <package>`. This is step is important,
  to avoid the circular dependency at this point. One needs to update this one
  OpenAPI document, without rebuilding the other components that depend on a
  now-outdated spec.
* Update the OpenAPI document by running the relevant test with overwrite set:
  `EXPECTORATE=overwrite cargo test test_nexus_openapi_internal` (changing the
  test name as necessary)
* This will cause the generated client to be updated which may break the build
  for dependent consumers
* Modify any dependent services to fix calls to the generated client

Note that if you make changes to both Nexus and Sled Agent simultaneously, you
may end up in a spot where neither can build and therefore neither OpenAPI
document can be generated. In this case, revert or comment out changes in one
so that the OpenAPI document can be generated.
