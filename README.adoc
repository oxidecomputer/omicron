= Oxide Control Plane

This repo houses the work-in-progress Oxide Rack control plane.

image::https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/workflows/Rust/badge.svg[]

Omicron is open-source.  But we're pretty focused on our own goals for the foreseeable future and not able to help external contributors.  Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for more information.

== Documentation

https://docs.oxide.computer/api[Docs are automatically generated for the public (externally-facing) API] based on the OpenAPI spec that itself is automatically generated from the server implementation.  You can generate your own docs for either the public API or any of the internal APIs by feeding the corresponding OpenAPI specs (in "./openapi") into an OpenAPI doc generator.

There are some internal design docs in the "./docs" directory.

For more design documentation and internal Rust API docs, see the https://rust.docs.corp.oxide.computer/omicron/[generated Rust documentation].  You can generate this yourself with:

[source,text]
----
$ cargo doc --document-private-items
----

Note that `--document-private-items` is configured by default, so you can actually just use `cargo doc`.

Folks with access to Oxide RFDs may find RFD 48 ("Control Plane Requirements") and other control plane RFDs relevant.  These are not currently publicly available.

== Build and run

You can **format the code** using `cargo fmt`.  Make sure to run this before pushing changes.  The CI checks that the code is correctly formatted.

You can **run the https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy[Clippy linter]** using `cargo clippy \-- -D warnings -A clippy::style`.  Make sure to run this before pushing changes.  The CI checks that the code is clippy-clean.

=== Installing Prerequisite Software

The following software may be installed automatically with the following scripts:

----
$ ./tools/install_prerequisites.sh
----

Alternatively, the manual installation steps as follows:

Both normal execution and the test suite expect certain binaries (described below) on your PATH.

. libpq, the PostgreSQL client library
+
--
We use Diesel's PostgreSQL support to connect to CockroachDB (which is wire-compatible with PostgreSQL).  Diesel uses the native libpq to do this.  You can get the client library with:

* Helios: `pkg install library/postgresql-13`
* Linux: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`
* Mac: `brew install postgresql`

After doing this, you should have the `pg_config` command on your PATH.  For example, on Helios, you'd want `/opt/ooce/bin` on your PATH.
--
. pkg-config, a tool for querying installed libraries
+
--

* Helios: `pkg install pkg-config`
* Linux: `sudo apt-get install pkg-config`
* Mac: `brew install pkg-config`

After doing this, you should have the `pkg-config` command on your PATH.  For
example, on Helios, you'd want `/usr/bin` on your PATH.
--
. CockroachDB v21.1.10.
+
The build and test suite expects to be able to start a single-node CockroachDB cluster using the `cockroach` executable on your PATH.
On illumos, MacOS, and Linux, you should be able to use the `tools/ci_download_cockroachdb` script to fetch the official CockroachDB binary.  It will be put into `./out/cockroachdb/bin/cockroach`.
Alternatively, you can follow the https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html[official CockroachDB installation instructions for your platform].

. ClickHouse >= v21.7.1.
+
The test suite expects a running instance of the ClickHouse database server.
The script `./tools/ci_download_clickhouse` can be used to download a pre-built binary for illumos, Linux, or macOS platforms. Once complete, you must manually add the binary (located at `./out/clickhouse/clickhouse`) to your PATH.
You may also install ClickHouse manually; instructions can be found https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/getting-started/install[here].
See <<_configuring_clickhouse>> for details on ClickHouse's setup and configuration files.
+
. Additional software requirements:
+
On an illumos-based machine (Helios, OmniOS), if you want to run the real (non-simulated) Sled Agent to run actual VMs with Propolis, make sure your packages are up to date, and you have the `brand/omicron1/tools` package:
+
[source,text]
----
pkg install brand/omicron1/tools
pkg install pkg:/package/pkg
pkg update
----

=== Running (Simulated) Omicron

NOTE: If you'd like to run on Helios, refer to <<Deploying Omicron>> below.

To **run Omicron** you need to run four programs:

* a CockroachDB cluster.  For development, you can use the `omicron-dev` tool in this repository to start a single-node CockroachDB cluster **that will delete the database when you shut it down.**
* a ClickHouse server. You should use the `omicron-dev` tool for this as well, see below, and as with CockroachDB,
the database files will be deleted when you stop the program.
* `nexus`: the guts of the control plane
* `sled-agent-sim`: a simulator for the component that manages a single sled

The easiest way to start the required databases is to use the built-in `omicron-dev` tool.  This tool assumes that the `cockroach` and `clickhouse` executables are on your PATH, and match the versions above.

. Start CockroachDB using `omicron-dev db-run`:

. `nexus` requires a configuration file to run.  You can use `nexus/examples/config.toml` to start with.  Build and run it like this:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cargo run --bin=nexus -- nexus/examples/config.toml
...
listening: http://127.0.0.1:12220
----
Nexus can also serve the web console. Instructions for generating the static assets and pointing Nexus to them are https://github.com/oxidecomputer/console/blob/main/docs/serve-from-nexus.md[here]. Without console assets, Nexus will still start and run normally as an API. A few link:./nexus/src/external_api/console_api.rs[console-specific routes] will 404.

. `sled-agent-sim` only accepts configuration on the command line.  Run it with a uuid identifying itself (this would be a uuid for the sled it's managing), an IP:port for itself, and the IP:port of `nexus`'s _internal_ interface.  Using default config, this might look like this:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cargo run --bin=sled-agent-sim -- $(uuidgen) 127.0.0.1:12345 127.0.0.1:12221
...
Jun 02 12:21:50.989 INFO listening, local_addr: 127.0.0.1:12345, component: dropshot
----

. `oximeter` is similar to `nexus`, requiring a configuration file. You can use `oximeter/collector/config.toml`, and the whole thing can be run with:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cargo run --bin=oximeter -- oximeter/collector/config.toml

----

Once everything is up and running, you can use `curl` directly to hit either of
the servers.  But it's easier to use the [`oxide` CLI](https://docs.oxide.computer/cli/manual) (see below).

== Docker image

This repo includes a Dockerfile that builds an image containing the Nexus and sled agent.  There's a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes the Docker image.  This is used by the https://github.com/oxidecomputer/console/[console] project for prototyping, demoing, and testing.  This is **not** the way Omicron will be deployed on production systems, but it's a useful vehicle for working with it.

== Quick demo

The `oxide` CLI can be installed from the [latest
release](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/cli/releases).

Run `oxide auth login` to authenticate with your Oxide account. Alternatively,
`oxide` will respect the `OXIDE_TOKEN` and `OXIDE_HOST` environment variables.

If you find bugs or have feedback, leave it on the [cli
repo](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/cli/issues).

Here's a small demo that creates a project, creates an instance, and attaches a disk to it:

}

# Alternatively, you can use the API command to run any endpoint.
# This operates like a fancy, authenticated curl.

$ oxide api --help
Makes an authenticated HTTP request to the Oxide API and prints the response.

The endpoint argument should be a path of a Oxide API endpoint.

The default HTTP request method is "GET" normally and "POST" if any parameters
were added. Override the method with `--method`.

Pass one or more `-f/--raw-field` values in "key=value" format to add static string
parameters to the request payload. To add non-string or otherwise dynamic values, see
`--field` below. Note that adding request parameters will automatically switch the
request method to POST. To send the parameters as a GET query string instead, use
`--method GET`.

The `-F/--field` flag has magic type conversion based on the format of the value:

- literal values "true", "false", "null", and integer/float numbers get converted to
  appropriate JSON types;
- if the value starts with "@", the rest of the value is interpreted as a
  filename to read the value from. Pass "-" to read from standard input.

Raw request body may be passed from the outside via a file specified by `--input`.
Pass "-" to read from standard input. In this mode, parameters specified via
`--field` flags are serialized into URL query parameters.

In `--paginate` mode, all pages of results will sequentially be requested until
there are no more pages of results.

USAGE:
    oxide api [OPTIONS] <endpoint>

ARGS:
    <endpoint>
            The endpoint to request

OPTIONS:
    -d, --debug
            Print debug info

            [env: DEBUG=]

    -f, --raw-field <RAW_FIELD>
            Add a string parameter in key=value format

    -F, --field <FIELD>
            Add a typed parameter in key=value format

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -H, --header <HEADER>
            Add a HTTP request header in `key:value` format

    -i, --include
            Include HTTP response headers in the output

        --input <INPUT>
            The file to use as body for the HTTP request (use "-" to read from standard input)

            [default: ]

        --paginate
            Make additional HTTP requests to fetch all pages of results

== Deploying Omicron


Prerequisite: Have a machine already running Helios. An easy way to
do this is by using a https://github.com/oxidecomputer/helios-engvm[Helios VM].
ISOs are also available for download https://pkg.oxide.computer/install[here].

The control plane repository contains a packaging tool which bundles binaries
and SMF manifests. After building the expected binaries, they can be packaged
in a format which lets them be transferred to a Helios machine.

This tool acts on a `package-manifest.toml` file which describes the packages to be
bundled in the build.

Configuration files are used to select IP addresses, and to manage Zpools
utilized by the Sled Agent. These configuration files are located within
`smf/`, and likely need to be modified to use addresses and zpools which match
your hardware. Much of this configuration will be automated in the future
(e.g., IP addresses will be inferred and posted to a DNS system, Zpools will
automatically be detected on discovered disks), but for now it remains
hard-coded.

[source,text]
----
$ cargo build
$ ./target/debug/omicron-package package
----

The aforementioned package command fills a target directory of choice
(by default, `out/` within the omicron repository) with tarballs ready
to be unpacked as services.

To install the services on a target machine, the following command
may be executed:

[source,text]
----
# Note that "sudo" is required to install SMF services; an appropriate pfexec
# profile may also be used.
$ sudo ./target/debug/omicron-package install
----

This service installs a bootstrap service, which itself loads other
requested services. The bootstrap service is currently the only
service which is "persistent" across reboots - although it will
initialize other service as part of its setup sequence anyway.

[source,text]
----
# List all services:
$ svcs
# View zones managed by Omicron (prefixed with "oxz_"):
$ zoneadm list -cv
# View logs for a service:
$ pfexec tail -f $(pfexec svcs -z oxz_nexus -L nexus)
----

To uninstall all Omicron services from a machine, the following may be
executed:

[source,text]
----
$ sudo ./target/debug/omicron-package uninstall
----

=== Test Environment

When we deploy, we're effectively creating a number of different zones
for all the components that make up Omicron (Nexus, Clickhouse, Crucible, etc).
Since all these services run in different zones they cannot communicate with
each other (and Sled Agent in the global zone) via `localhost`. In practice,
we'll assign addresses as per RFD 63 as well as incorporating DNS based
service discovery.

For the purposes of local development today, we specify some hardcoded IPv6
unique local addresses in `fd00:1de::/16`:

[options="header"]
|===================================================================================================
| Service                    | Endpoint                                                             
| Sled Agent: Bootstrap      | `[::]:12346`                                                         
| Sled Agent: Dropshot API   | `[fd00:1de::]:12345`                                                 
| Cockroach DB               | `[fd00:1de::5]:32221`                                                
| Oximeter                   | `[fd00:1de::6]:12223`                                                
| Nexus: External API        | `[fd00:1de::7]:12220`                                                
| Nexus: Internal API        | `[fd00:1de::7]:12221`                                                
| Clickhouse                 | `[fd00:1de::8]:8123`                                                 
| Crucible Downstairs        | `[fd00:1de::9]:32345`, `[fd00:1de::10]:32345`, `[fd00:1de::11]:32345`
|===================================================================================================

Note that Sled Agent runs in the global zone and is the one responsible for bringing up all the other
other services and allocating them with vNICs and IPv6 addresses.

== Configuration reference

`nexus` requires a TOML configuration file.  There's an example in
`nexus/examples/config.toml`:

[source,toml]
----
include::nexus/examples/config.toml[]
----

Supported config properties include:

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Example
|Required?
|Description

|`database.url`
|`"postgresql://root@127.0.0.1:32221/omicron?sslmode=disable"`
|Yes
|URL identifying the CockroachDB instance(s) to connect to.  CockroachDB is used for all persistent data.

|`dropshot_external`
|
|Yes
|Dropshot configuration for the external server (i.e., the one that operators and developers using the Oxide rack will use).  Specific properties are documented below, but see the Dropshot README for details.

|`dropshot_external.bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port for the **external** API (i.e., the one that operators and developers using the Oxide rack will use).  In general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not (yet?) supported.

|`dropshot_external.request_body_max_bytes`
|`1000`
|Yes
|Specifies the maximum request body size for the **external** API.

|`dropshot_internal`
|
|Yes
|Dropshot configuration for the internal server (i.e., the one used by the sled agent).  Specific properties are documented below, but see the Dropshot README for details.

|`dropshot_internal.bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port for the **internal** API (i.e., the one used by the sled agent).  In general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not (yet?) supported.

|`dropshot_internal.request_body_max_bytes`
|`1000`
|Yes
|Specifies the maximum request body size for the **internal** API.

|`id`
|`"e6bff1ff-24fb-49dc-a54e-c6a350cd4d6c"`
|Yes
|Unique identifier for this Nexus instance

|`log`
|
|Yes
|Logging configuration.  Specific properties are documented below, but see the Dropshot README for details.

|`log.mode`
|`"file"`
|Yes
|Controls where server logging will go.  Valid modes are `"stderr-terminal"` and `"file".  If the mode is `"stderr-terminal"`, human-readable output, with colors and other terminal formatting if possible, will be sent to stderr.  If the mode is `"file"`, Bunyan-format output will be sent to the filesystem path given by `log.path`.  See also `log.if_exists`, which controls the behavior if the destination path already exists.

|`log.level`
|`"info"`
|Yes
|Specifies what severity of log messages should be included in the log.  Valid values include `"trace"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, and `"critical"`, which are increasing order of severity.  Log messages at the specified level and more severe levels will be included in the log.

|`log.path`
|`"logs/server.log"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property determines the path to the log file.
See also `log.if_exists`.

|`log.if_exists`
|`"append"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property specifies what to do if the destination log file already exists.  Valid values include `"append"` (which appends to the existing file), `"truncate"` (which truncates the existing file and then uses it as though it had just been created), and `"fail"` (which causes the server to exit immediately with an error).

=== Configuring ClickHouse

The ClickHouse binary uses several sources for its configuration. The binary expects an XML
config file, usually named `config.xml` to be available, or one may be specified with the
`-C` command-line flag. The binary also includes a minimal configuration _embedded_ within
it, which will be used if no configuration file is given or present in the current directory.
The server also accepts command-line flags for overriding the values of the configuration
parameters.

The packages downloaded by `ci_download_clickhouse` include a `config.xml` file with them.
You should probably run ClickHouse via the `omicron-dev` tool, but if you decide to run it
manually, you can start the server with:

[source,text]
$ /path/to/clickhouse server --config-file /path/to/config.xml

The configuration file contains a large number of parameters, but most of them are described
with comments in the included `config.xml`, or you may learn more about them
https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings/[here]
and https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/settings/[here]. Parameters may be updated
in the `config.xml`, and the server will automatically reload them. You may also specify
many of them on the command-line with:

[source,text]
$ /path/to/clickhouse server --config-file /path/to/config.xml -- --param_name param_value ...

=== Generated Service Clients and Updating

Each service is a Dropshot server that presents an HTTP API. The description of
that API is serialized as an
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI] document which we store
in link:./openapi[`omicron/openapi`] and check in to this repo. In order to
ensure that changes to those APIs are made intentionally, each service contains
a test that validates that the current API matches. This allows us 1. to catch
accidental changes as test failures and 2. to explicitly observe API changes
during code review (and in the git history).

We also use these OpenAPI documents as the source for the clients we generate
using https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor[Progenitor]. Clients are
automatically updated when the coresponding OpenAPI document is modified.

Note that Omicron contains a nominally circular dependency:

* Nexus depends on the Sled Agent client
* The Sled Agent client is derived from the OpenAPI document emitted by Sled Agent
* Sled Agent depends on the Nexus client
* The Nexus client is derived from the OpenAPI document emitted by Nexus

We effectively "break" this circular dependency by virtue of the OpenAPI
documents being checked in.

In general, changes any service API **require the following set of build steps**:

* Make changes to the service API
* Build the package for the modified service alone. This can be done by changing
  directories there, or `cargo build -p <package>`. This is step is important,
  to avoid the circular dependency at this point. One needs to update this one
  OpenAPI document, without rebuilding the other components that depend on a
  now-outdated spec.
* Update the OpenAPI document by running the relevant test with overwrite set:
  `EXPECTORATE=overwrite cargo test test_nexus_openapi_internal` (changing the
  test name as necessary)
* This will cause the generated client to be updated which may break the build
  for dependent consumers
* Modify any dependent services to fix calls to the generated client

Note that if you make changes to both Nexus and Sled Agent simultaneously, you
may end up in a spot where neither can build and therefore neither OpenAPI
document can be generated. In this case, revert or comment out changes in one
so that the OpenAPI document can be generated.
