//! # Oxide Control Plane
//!
//! The overall architecture for the Oxide Control Plane is described in [RFD
//! 61](https://61.rfd.oxide.computer/).  This crate implements common facilities
//! used in the control plane.  Other top-level crates implement pieces of the
//! control plane (e.g., `omicron_nexus`).
//!
//! The best documentation for the control plane is RFD 61 and the rustdoc in
//! this crate.  Since this crate doesn't provide externally-consumable
//! interfaces, the rustdoc (generated with `--document-private-items`) is
//! intended primarily for engineers working on this crate.

// We only use rustdoc for internal documentation, including private items, so
// it's expected that we'll have links to private items in the docs.
#![allow(rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links)]
// TODO(#32): Remove this exception once resolved.
#![allow(clippy::field_reassign_with_default)]
