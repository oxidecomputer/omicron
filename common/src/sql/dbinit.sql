/*
 * dbinit.sql: raw SQL to initialize a database for use by Omicron
 *
 * It's not clear what the long-term story for managing the database schema will
 * be.  For now, this file can be used by the test suite and by developers (via
 * the "omicron-dev" program) to set up a local database with which to run the
 * system.
 */

/*
 * Important CockroachDB notes:
 *
 *    The syntax STRING(63) means a Unicode string with at most 63 code points,
 *    not 63 bytes.  In many cases, Nexus itself will validate a string's
 *    byte count or code points, so it's still reasonable to limit ourselves to
 *    powers of two (or powers-of-two-minus-one) to improve storage utilization.
 *
 *    For timestamps, CockroachDB's docs recommend TIMESTAMPTZ rather than
 *    TIMESTAMP.  This does not change what is stored with each datum, but
 *    rather how it's interpreted when clients use it.  It should make no
 *    difference to us, so we stick with the recommendation.
 *
 *    We avoid explicit foreign keys due to this warning from the docs: "Foreign
 *    key dependencies can significantly impact query performance, as queries
 *    involving tables with foreign keys, or tables referenced by foreign keys,
 *    require CockroachDB to check two separate tables. We recommend using them
 *    sparingly."

 * We assume the database and user do not already exist so that we don't

/*
 * Roles built into the system
 *
 * You can think of a built-in role as an opaque token to which we assign a
 * hardcoded set of permissions.  The role that we call "project.viewer"
 * corresponds to the "viewer" role on the "project" resource.  A user that has
 * this role on a particular Project is granted various read-only permissions on
 * that Project.  The specific permissions associated with the role are defined
 * in Omicron's Polar (Oso) policy file.
 *
 * A built-in role like "project.viewer" has four parts:
 *
 * * resource type: "project"
 * * role name: "viewer"
 * * full name: "project.viewer"
 * * description: "Project Viewer"
 *
 * Internally, we can treat the tuple (resource type, role name) as a composite
 * primary key.  Externally, we expose this as the full name.  This is
 * consistent with RFD 43 and other IAM systems.
 *
 * These fields look awfully close to the identity metadata that we use for most
 * other tables.  But they're just different enough that we can't use most of
 * the same abstractions:
 *
 * * "id": We have no need for a uuid because the (resource_type, role_name) is
 *   already unique and immutable.
 * * "name": What we call "full name" above could instead be called "name",
 *   which would be consistent with other identity metadata.  But it's not a
 *   legal "name" because of the period, and it would be confusing to have
 *   "resource type", "role name", and "name".
 * * "time_created": not that useful because it's whenever the system was
 *   initialized, and we have plenty of other timestamps for that
 * * "time_modified": does not apply because the role cannot be changed
 * * "time_deleted" does not apply because the role cannot be deleted
 *
 * If the set of roles and their permissions are fixed, why store them in the
 * database at all?  Because what's dynamic is the assignment of roles to users.
 * We [will] have a separate table that says "user U has role ROLE on resource
 * RESOURCE".  How do we represent the ROLE part of this association?  We use a
 * foreign key into this "role_builtin" table.
