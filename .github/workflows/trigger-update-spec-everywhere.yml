# This workflow starts the Rube Goldberg machine of updating the spec everywhere
# by making a PR to the oxide.ts repo.
# In the future, once we have real releases and versioning we will likely only
# want to run this on a tag push, but for now we will run it on pushes to main
# since then the docs and clients will be updated for any changes to the omicron
# nexus external API.
