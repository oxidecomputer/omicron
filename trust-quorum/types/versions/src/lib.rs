//! # Adding a new API version
//!
//! When adding a new API version N with added or changed types:
//!
//! 1. Create `<version_name>/mod.rs`, where `<version_name>` is the lowercase
//!    form of the new version's identifier.
//!
//! 2. Add to the end of this list:
//!
//!    ```rust,ignore
//!    #[path = "<version_name>/mod.rs"]
//!    pub mod vN;
//!    ```
//!
//! 3. Add your types to the new module, mirroring the module structure from
//!    earlier versions.
//!
//! 4. Update `latest.rs` with new and updated types from the new version.
//!
//! For more information, see [RFD 619], off which this approach is modeled.
