# We allow chrony to step the system clock if we are more than a day out,
# regardless of how many clock updates have occurred since boot.
# The boundary NTP servers are configured with local reference mode, which
# means that if they start up without external connectivity, they will appear
# as authoritative servers even if they are advertising January 1987
# (which is the default system clock on a gimlet after boot).
# This configuration allows a one-off adjustment once RSS begins and the
# boundary servers are synchronised, after which the clock will advance
# monotonically forwards.
makestep 86400 -1

# When a leap second occurs we slew the clock over approximately 37 seconds.
