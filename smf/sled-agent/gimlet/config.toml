# Sled Agent Configuration

# Identifies whether sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet or a gimlet.
#
# If this is set to "scrimlet", the sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet.
# If this is set to "gimlet", the sled agent treats itself as a gimlet.
# If this is set to "auto":
# - On illumos, the sled automatically detects whether or not it is a scrimlet.
# - On all other platforms, the sled assumes it is a gimlet.

# TODO: This field should be removed once Gimlets have the ability to auto-detect
# this information.

# An optional data link from which we extract a MAC address.
# This is used as a unique identifier for the bootstrap address.

# If empty, this will be equivalent to the first result from:

# This field is only needed for the gimlet configuration: helios configures a
# swap device by default.
