# Sled Agent Configuration

# Identifies whether sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet or a gimlet.
#
# If this is set to "scrimlet", the sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet.
# If this is set to "gimlet", the sled agent treats itself as a gimlet.
# If this is set to "auto":
# - On illumos, the sled automatically detects whether or not it is a scrimlet.
# - On all other platforms, the sled assumes it is a gimlet.

# TODO: This field should be removed once Gimlets have the ability to auto-detect
# this information.

# The amount of memory held back for services which always have one instance on
# every Gimlet.  This currently includes some additional terms reflecting OS
# memory use under load.

# As of writing, this is the sum of the following items from RFD 413:
# * Network buffer slush: 18 GiB
# * Other kernel heap: 20 GiB
# * ZFS ARC minimum: 5 GiB
# * Sled agent: 0.5 GiB
# * Maghemite: 0.25 GiB
# * NTP: 0.25 GiB

# Percentage of otherwise-unbudgeted physical DRAM to use for the VMM reservoir,
# which guest memory is pulled from.
#
# The budget including this number is described in more detail in RFD 413. There
# are two key details to reiterate here. First, this number is chosen so that
# there is no change in overall VMM reservoir size on Gimlets with 1 TiB of
# DRAM, compared to our initial budgeting strategy. Second, whatever the value
# here, it should be at or below the percentage of memory requested by Propolis
# even if a sled has a full complement of minimum-sized VMs. Any higher and we
# risk swapping or OOMing under typical conditions; bad for everyone.
#
# We expect this should be higher, but currently a lack of long-uptime
# varied-usage measurements leads us to be cautious.

# Swap device size for the system. The device is a sparsely allocated zvol on
# the internal zpool of the M.2 that we booted from.
#
# If use of the VMM reservoir is configured, it is likely the system will not
# work without a swap device configured.
#
# We pick 256 GiB somewhat arbitrarily, since the device is sparsely
# allocated.
