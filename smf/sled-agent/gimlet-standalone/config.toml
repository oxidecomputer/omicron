# If this is set to "scrimlet", the sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet.
# If this is set to "gimlet", the sled agent treats itself as a gimlet.
# If this is set to "auto":
# - On illumos, the sled automatically detects whether or not it is a scrimlet.
# - On all other platforms, the sled assumes it is a gimlet.

# TODO: This field should be removed once Gimlets have the ability to auto-detect
# this information.
