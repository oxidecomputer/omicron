# Sled Agent Configuration

# Identifies if the sled should be unconditionally treated as a scrimlet.
#
# If this is set to "true", the sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet.
# If this is set to "false", the sled agent treats itself as a gimlet.
# If this is unset:
# - On illumos, the sled automatically detects whether or not it is a scrimlet.
# - On all other platforms, the sled assumes it is a gimlet.

# Identifies the revision of the sidecar that is attached, if one is attached.
# TODO: This field should be removed once Gimlets have the ability to auto-detect
# this information.

# An optional data link from which we extract a MAC address.
# This is used as a unique identifier for the bootstrap address.

# If empty, this will be equivalent to the first result from:
