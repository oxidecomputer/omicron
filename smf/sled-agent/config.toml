# A file-backed zpool can be manually created with the following:
# # truncate -s 10GB testpool.vdev
# # zpool create oxp_d462a7f7-b628-40fe-80ff-4e4189e2d62b "$PWD/testpool.vdev"
#
# Note that you'll need to create one such zpool for each below, with a
# different vdev for each.

# An optional data link from which we extract a MAC address.

# If empty, this will be equivalent to the first result from:
# $ dladm show-phys -p -o LINK

# MAC address of the internet gateway in the local network, i.e., of the above
# IP address.
#
# NOTE: This is currently configured for the lab. Developers should override
# this with whatever value they wish to provide inbound connectivity to guests
# in their local network, using the current workaround methods in OPTE. See
# how-to-run.adoc for details on how to determine the value for your network.
