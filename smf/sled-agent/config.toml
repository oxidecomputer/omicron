# Address of the Sled Agent itself
#
# With the usage of non-global zones, we no longer can use localhost addresses,
# as Nexus (within a Zone) is effectively "on a different machine" from the
# sled agent.
#
# This address may be allocated with the following command:
#
# pfexec ipadm create-addr -t -T static -a 192.168.1.201 $(dladm show-phys -p -o LINK)/sled4
# |      |                                               |
# Please |                                               |
#        Create a temporary static address               |
#                                                        On whatever physical datalink I have
