# Sled Agent Configuration

# Identifies if the sled should be unconditionally treated as a scrimlet.
#
# If this is set to "true", the sled agent treats itself as a scrimlet.
# If this is set to "false", the sled agent treats itself as a gimlet.
# If this is unset:
# - On illumos, the sled automatically detects whether or not it is a scrimlet.
# - On all other platforms, the sled assumes it is a gimlet.
