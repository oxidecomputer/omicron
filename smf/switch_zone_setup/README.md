`authorized_keys` is from [`oxidecomputer/support-piv-tokens@36abeb82`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/support-piv-tokens/blob/36abeb82aacb3640be2f6c988e49844356cf65a8/authorized_keys).

If the set of authorized keys changes, it should also be updated in Hubris
(`support/support_tokens/authorized_keys`)
