# responses, and determine its location via the intersection of the names listed
# below (for all ports which returned a successful response). This process can
# fail if too few SPs respond (leaving us with 2 or more possible locations) or
# if there is a miscabling that results in an unsolvable system (e.g.,
# determination 0 reports "switch0" and determination 1 reports "switch1").
