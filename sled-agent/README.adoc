= Sled Agent

This directory contains the per-sled "agent", responsible for managing
local hardware and instances.

== Real vs Simulated

This subdirectory contains implementations of both a "simulated" and "real"
Sled Agent. The simulated agent allows testing state machine management in a
low-overhead environment. Where reasonable, decision-making logic is shared
between the two implementations.

== Code Tour

* `src/bin`: Contains binaries for the sled agent (and simulated sled agent).
* `src/bootstrap`: Contains bootstrap-related services, operating on a distinct
  HTTP endpoint from typical sled operation.
* `src/common`: Shared state machine code between the simulated and real sled agent.
* `src/sim`: Library code responsible for operating a simulated sled agent.
* `src/illumos`: Illumos-specific helpers for accessing OS utilities to manage a sled.

Additionally, there are some noteworthy top-level files used by the sled agent:

=== Launching Instances

* `src/instance_manager.rs`: Manages multiple instances on a sled.
* `src/instance.rs`: Manages a single instance.

=== Managing Sled-local Resources

* `src/storage_manager.rs`: Manages storage within a sled.
* `src/services.rs`: Manages services that are running within the sled.
* `src/updates.rs`: Manages packages installed on the sled.

=== HTTP Services

* `src/http_entrypoints.rs`: The HTTP API exposed by the Sled Agent.
* `src/params.rs`: Parameters to the HTTP endpoints.

As well as some utilities:

* `src/illumos/running_zone.rs`: RAII wrapper around a running Zone owned by the Sled Agent.
* `src/illumos/vnic.rs`: RAII wrapper around VNICs owned by the Sled Agent.

== Life of an Instance

NOTE: This process is subject to change. What follows attempts to be an
accurate description of the current implementation.

As a prerequisite for starting new instances, the Sled Agent takes the
following steps on initialization to manage OS-local resources.

.When booting, the Sled Agent...
. ... creates a ZFS filesystem for zones, called `rpool/zone`, mounted at `/zone`.
. ... identifies all Oxide-controlled zones (with the prefix `oxz_`)
and all Oxide-controlled VNICs (with the prefix `ox`), which are
removed from the machine.

.To allocate an instance on the Sled, the following steps occur:
. A request arrives via the HTTP server (typically from Nexus), requesting
an operation like `instance_put`.
. This request is routed to the `InstanceManager` through the `ensure` method.
If the instance already exists, it is identified by UUID and updated. Otherwise,
a new instance is created.
. A dedicated "control" VNIC is created by the Sled Agent, for use by the
instance's zone.
** This requires identifying a physical data-link device, and creating a new
VNIC on top of it.
. An omicron-branded zone is created for the instance. Within this zone...
** ... Propolis' executable files exist.
** ... The previously created "control" VNIC is attached as a network interface.
** ... Necessary devices for virtualization (`/dev/{vmm,vmmctl,viona}`) are added.
. The zone is then booted. Once the SMF network milestone has been reached...
** ... An IP address is allocated on the aforementioned VNIC.
** ... Propolis' HTTP server is initialized, using this IP address.
** ... And the original request to "create an instance" is passed to this
Propolis server, where the actual VM initialization occurs.
. At this point, the instance is up and running, and the Sled Agent monitors it
such that Nexus may be notified if the VM changes state.

= TODOs

We track issues on Github using the following labels:

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%9B%B7+Sled+Agent%22[Sled Agent]
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A5%BE+bootstrap+services%22[Bootstrap Services]


However, the following are general areas of improvement for the Sled Agent:

* (Correctness) Plumbing of Nexus-customizable InstanceProperties, such as
image, bootrom, memory, vcpus.
* (Correctness) Integration of OPTE to manage the network and apply policy
changes as requested by Nexus.
* (Resilience) On initialization of the `InstanceManager`, the Sled Agent
currently removes all Zones and VNICs on the system with known magic prefixes.
Instead, these should be inspected and re-organized, especially to deal with a
case where the Sled Agent reboots, but customer VMs continue to execute on a
rack.
* (Performance) Minimize polling-based behavior, where possible. The Sled Agent
is responsible for launching zones, SMF services, and HTTP servers - for all of
these, the agent uses polling with timeouts to monitor progress between
"starting" and "actually running and responding to requests". If possible, it
would be preferable to replace these timeouts with event-triggered behavior,
which would avoid unnecessary stalls.
