/// Describes Oxide API objects that can be simulated here in the sled agent
///
/// We only simulate these objects from the perspective of an API consumer, which
/// means for example accepting a request to boot it, reporting the current state
/// as "starting", and then some time later reporting that the state is
/// "running".
///
/// The basic idea is that for any type that we want to simulate (e.g.,
/// Instances), there's a `CurrentState` (which you could think of as "stopped",
/// "starting", "running", "stopping") and a `RequestedState` (which would only
/// be "stopped" and "running" -- you can't ask an Instance to transition to
/// "starting" or "stopping")
///
/// (The term "state" here is a bit overloaded.  `CurrentState` refers to the
/// state of the object itself that's being simulated.  This might be an Instance
/// that is currently in state "running".  `RequestedState` refers to a requested
/// _change_ to the state of the object.  The state of the _simulated_ object
/// includes both of these: e.g., a "starting" Instance that is requested to be
/// "running".  So in most cases in the interface below, the state is represented
/// by a tuple of `(CurrentState, Option<RequestedState>)`.)
///
/// Transitioning between states is always either synchronous (which means that
/// we make the transition immediately) or asynchronous (which means that we
/// first transition to some intermediate state and some time later finish the
/// transition to the requested state).  An Instance transition from "Stopped" to
/// "Destroyed" is synchronous.  An Instance transition from "Stopped" to
/// "Running" is asynchronous; it first goes to "Starting" and some time later
/// becomes "Running".
///
/// It's expected that an object can begin another user-requested state
/// transition no matter what state it's in, although some particular transitions
/// may be disallowed (e.g., "reboot" from a stopped state).
///
/// The implementor determines the set of possible states (via `CurrentState` and
/// `RequestedState`) as well as what transitions are allowed.
///
/// When an asynchronous state change completes, we notify the control plane via
/// the `notify()` function.
