= illumos commands

This directory contains wrappers around a variety of "illumos-only" commands.

At the moment, these are wrappers around CLI-based invocations, and therefore
can be compiled on any OS. We enable this behavior (even though these commands
would likely result in an error on other OSes) to be more permissive with
rust analyzer support.
