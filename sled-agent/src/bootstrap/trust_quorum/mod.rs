//! The entry point for the trust quorum code
//!
//! The Trust quorum relies on IPv6 multicast discovery, rack secret handling,
//! and the SPDM protocol.
//!
//! Below is the trust quorum protocol for share retrieval over TCP.
//!
//! The following protocol is shown between two sleds only, but multicast
//! discovery and share requests will continue to run until enough shares
//! have been received to recreate the rack secret.
