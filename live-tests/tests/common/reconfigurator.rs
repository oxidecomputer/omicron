/// Modify the system by editing the current target blueprint
///
/// More precisely, this function:
///
/// - fetches the current target blueprint
/// - creates a new BlueprintBuilder based on it
/// - invokes the caller's `edit_fn`, which may modify the builder however it
///   likes
/// - generates a new blueprint (thus based on the current target)
/// - uploads the new blueprint
/// - sets the new blueprint as the current target
/// - enables the new blueprint
///
/// ## Errors
///
/// This function fails if the current target blueprint is not already enabled.
/// That's because a disabled target blueprint means somebody doesn't want
/// Reconfigurator running or doesn't want it using that blueprint.  We don't
/// want the test to inadvertently override that behavior.  In a typical use
/// case, a developer enables the initial target blueprint before running these
/// tests and then doesn't need to think about it again for the lifetime of
/// their test environment.
