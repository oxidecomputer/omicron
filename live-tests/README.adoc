= Omicron live tests

The `omicron-live-tests` package contains automated tests that operate in the context of an already-deployed "real" Oxide system (e.g., `a4x2` or our `london` or `madrid` test environments).  This is a home for automated tests for all kinds of Reconfigurator behavior (e.g., add/expunge of all zones, add/expunge sled, upgrades, etc.).  It can probably be used for non-Reconfigurator behavior, too.

This package is not built or tested by default because the tests generally can't work in a dev environment and there's no way to have `cargo` build and check them but not run the tests by default.

== Why a separate test suite?

What makes these tests different from the rest of the test suite is that they require connectivity to the underlay network of the deployed system and they make API calls to various components in that system and they assume that this will behave like a real production system.  By contrast, the normal tests instead _set up_ a bunch of components using simulated sled agents and localhost networking, which is great for starting from a predictable state and running tests in parallel, but the simulated sled agents and networking make it impossible to exercise quite a lot of Reconfigurator's functionality.  

There are also the `end-to-end-tests`.  That environment is more realistic than the main test suite, but not faithful enough for many Reconfigurator tests.

== Production systems

There are some safeguards so that these tests won't run on production systems: they refuse to run if they find any Oxide-hardware sleds in the system whose serial numbers don't correspond to known test environments.

== Usage

These tests are not currently run automatically (though they are _built_ in CI).

You can run them yourself.  First, deploy Omicron using `a4x2` or one of the hardware test rigs.  In your Omicron workspace, run `cargo xtask live-tests` to build an archive and then follow the instructions:

```
$ cargo xtask live-tests

To use this:

1. Copy the tarball to the switch zone in a deployed Omicron system.

     e.g., scp \
              /home/dap/omicron-work/target/live-tests-archive.tgz \
              root@YOUR_SCRIMLET_GZ_IP:/zone/oxz_switch/root/root

2. Copy the `cargo-nextest` binary to the same place.

     e.g., scp \
              $(which cargo-nextest) \
              root@YOUR_SCRIMLET_GZ_IP:/zone/oxz_switch/root/root

3. On that system, unpack the tarball with:

     tar xzf live-tests-archive.tgz

4. On that system, run tests with:

     TMPDIR=/var/tmp ./cargo-nextest nextest run \
         --archive-file live-tests-archive/omicron-live-tests.tar.zst \
         --workspace-remap live-tests-archive
```

Follow the instructions, run the tests, and you'll see the usual `nextest`-style output:

```
root@oxz_switch:~# TMPDIR=/var/tmp ./cargo-nextest nextest run          --archive-file live-tests-archive/omicron-live-tests.tar.zst          --workspace-remap live-tests-archive
