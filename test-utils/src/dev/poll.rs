/// Poll the given closure until it succeeds, returns a permanent error, or
/// a given time has expired
///
/// This is intended in the test suite and developer tools for situations where
/// you've taken some action and want to wait for its effects to be observable
/// _and_ you have no way to directly wait for the observable event.  **This
/// approach is generally not applicable for production code.  See crate::backoff
/// for that.**  This is similar to the exponential backoff facility provided by
/// the "backoff" crate, but this is a non-randomized, constant-interval retry,
/// so it's not really a "backoff".
///
/// Note that `poll_max` is not a bound on how long this function can take.
/// Rather, it's the time beyond which this function will stop trying to check
/// `cond`.  If `cond` takes an arbitrary amount of time, this function will too.
///
/// This function is intended for those situations where it's tempting to sleep
/// for "long enough" (often people pick 1, 5, or 10 seconds) and then either
/// assume the thing happened or check the condition at that point.  We must
/// remember Clulow's lament:
///
///    Timeouts, timeouts: always wrong!
///    Some too short and some too long.
///
/// In fact, in trying to balance shorter test execution time against spurious
/// timeouts, people often choose a timeout value that is both too long _and_ too
/// short, resulting in both long test runs and spurious failures.  A better
/// pattern is provided here: check the condition relatively frequently with a
/// much longer maximum timeout -- long enough that timeout expiration
/// essentially reflects incorrect behavior.
///
/// But again: this mechanism is a last resort when no mechanism exists to
/// wait directly for the condition.
