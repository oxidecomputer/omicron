/// of the system, how many CockroachDB nodes should be part of the cluster,
/// what system version the system should be running, etc.  It would _not_
/// include things like which services should be running on which sleds or which
/// host OS version should be on each sled because that's up to the control
/// plane to decide.  (To be clear, the intent is that for extenuating
/// circumstances, people could exercise control over such things, but that
/// would not be part of normal operation.)
///
/// The current policy is pretty limited.  It's aimed primarily at supporting
/// the add/remove sled use case.

/// Describes a complete set of software and configuration for the system
// Blueprints are a fundamental part of how the system modifies itself.  Each
// blueprint completely describes all of the software and configuration
// that the control plane manages.  See the nexus/deployment crate-level
// documentation for details.
//
// Blueprints are different from policy.  Policy describes the things that an
// operator would generally want to control.  The blueprint describes the
// details of implementing that policy that an operator shouldn't have to deal
// with.  For example, the operator might write policy that says "I want
// 5 external DNS zones".  The system could then generate a blueprint that
// _has_ 5 external DNS zones on 5 specific sleds.  The blueprint includes all
// the details needed to achieve that, including which image these zones should
// run, which zpools their persistent data should be stored on, their public and
// private IP addresses, their internal DNS names, etc.
//
// It must be possible for multiple Nexus instances to execute the same
// blueprint concurrently and converge to the same thing.  Thus, these _cannot_
// be how a blueprint works:
//
// - "add a Nexus zone" -- two Nexus instances operating concurrently would
//   add _two_ Nexus zones (which is wrong)
// - "ensure that there is a Nexus zone on this sled with this id" -- the IP
//   addresses and images are left unspecified.  Two Nexus instances could pick
//   different IPs or images for the zone.
//
// This is why blueprints must be so detailed.  The key principle here is that
// **all the work of ensuring that the system do the right thing happens in one
// process (the update planner in one Nexus instance).  Once a blueprint has
// been committed, everyone is on the same page about how to execute it.**  The
// intent is that this makes both planning and executing a lot easier.  In
// particular, by the time we get to execution, all the hard choices have
// already been made.
//
// Currently, blueprints are limited to describing only the set of Omicron
// zones deployed on each host and some supporting configuration (e.g., DNS).
// This is aimed at supporting add/remove sleds.  The plan is to grow this to
// include more of the system as we support more use cases.
