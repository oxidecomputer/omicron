    ///      add two to reach our desired policy of 5 keepers
    ///   2. The planner adds 2 new keeper zones to the blueprint
    ///   3. The planner will also add **one** new keeper to the `keepers` field
    ///      below that matches one of the deployed zones.
    ///   4. The executor will start the new keeper process that was added
    ///      to the `keepers` field, attempt to add it to the keeper cluster
    ///      by pushing configuration updates to the other keepers, and then
    ///      updating the clickhouse server configurations to know about the
    ///      new keeper.
    ///   5. If the keeper is successfully added, as reflected in inventory,
    ///      then steps 3 and 4 above will be repeated for the next keeper
    ///      process.
    ///   6. If the keeper is not successfully added by the executor it will
    ///      continue to retry indefinitely.
    ///   7. If the zone is expunged while the planner has it as part of its
    ///      desired state in `keepers`, and the executor is trying to add it,
    ///      the keeper will be removed from `keepers` in the next blueprint.
