    //
    // (1) It's hard to hang onto the "lock" for too long, at least as a writer,
    //     because you only ever have the write lock inside a closure (e.g.,
    //     `send_modify`).  That closure can't be async.  This is a good thing.
    //     It means we only hold the write lock for very brief periods while we
    //     mutate the data, using it to protect data and not code.
    //
    // (2) `watch::Receiver` provides a really handy `wait_for()` method` that
    //     we use in `wait_for_drained()`.  Besides being convenient, this
    //     would be surprisingly hard for us to implement ourselves with a
    //     `Mutex`.  Traditionally, you'd use a combination Mutex/Condvar for
    //     this.  But we'd want to use a `std` Mutex (since tokio Mutex's
    //     cancellation behavior is abysmal), but we don't want to block on a
    //     std `Condvar` in an async thread.  There are options here (e.g.,
