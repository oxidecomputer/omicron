/// A store to track reconfigurator states: the main entrypoint for
/// reconfigurator simulation.
///
/// This store has key-based storage for systems and their states, and allows
/// for append-only storage of new states.
///
/// # Implementation notes
///
/// We currently index by UUIDs, but we could index by the hash of the contents
/// and make it a Merkle tree just as well. (We'd have to hook up canonical
/// hashing etc; it's a bunch of work but not too difficult). If there's a
/// compelling reason to use Merkle trees, we should switch over to that.
///
/// Currently, all data within is stored via `Arc` instances to enable cheap
/// cloning. In the future, it would be interesting to store data at the top
/// level, and only store references to it within each `SimState`. (The
/// references could be UUIDs, Rust `&` references, or content-addressed
/// hashes.) This does add some complexity, though, and there isn't a clear
/// benefit at the moment. For more, see the comment within the definition of
/// `system.rs`'s `SimSystem`.
