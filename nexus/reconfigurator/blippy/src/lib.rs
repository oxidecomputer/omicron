//! Blippy: the blueprint checker
//!
//! [`Blippy`] performs a variety of checks on blueprints to ensure they are
//! internally-consistent (e.g., "every in-service zone that should have one or
//! more datasets do", or "any given external IP address is used by at most one
//! in-service zone"). It emits [`BlippyReport`]s in the form of a list of
//! [`BlippyNote`]s, each of which has an associated severity and parent
//! component (typically a sled).
