# Reconfigurator

**Reconfigurator** is a project and control plane facility for dynamically reconfiguring the software running on the Oxide rack.  This will be used for a variety of use cases:

* Adding, removing, or replacing sleds (gracefully or otherwise)
* Upgrading any Oxide-delivered software (see below)
* Scale-up and scale-down of control plane services
* Automated response to hardware failure

For those with access (primarily, Oxide employees), see:

* [RFD 418 Towards automated system update](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/418).
* [Reconfigurator GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/oxidecomputer/projects/44?pane=info).
