//! Interfaces for Nexus under test.
//!
//! By splitting these interfaces into a new crate, we can avoid a circular
//! dependency on Nexus during testing.
//!
//! Both Nexus unit tests and Integration tests want to able to share
//! utilities for launching Nexus, a multi-service setup process that exists in
//! `nexus-test-utils`.
//!
//! Without a separate test interface crate, this dependency looks like the
//! following (note: "->" means "depends on")
//!
//! - nexus -> nexus-test-utils
//! - nexus-test-utils -> nexus
//! - integration tests -> nexus
//! - integration tests -> nexus-test-utils
//!
//! As we can see, this introduces a circular dependency between
//! `nexus-test-utils` and `nexus`.
//!
//! However, by separating out the portion of `nexus` used by `nexus-test-utils`
//! into a separate trait, we can break the circular dependency:
//!
//! - nexus -> nexus-test-interface
//! - nexus -> nexus-test-utils
//! - nexus-test-utils -> nexus-test-interface
//! - integration tests -> nexus
//! - integration tests -> nexus-test-utils

    // Previously, as a dataset was created (within the sled agent),
    // we'd use an internal API from Nexus to record that the dataset
    // now exists. In other words, Sled Agent was in control, by telling
    // Nexus when it should record persistent information about datasets.
    //
    // However, as of https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/pull/1954,
    // control over dataset provisioning is shifting to Nexus. There is
    // a short window where RSS controls dataset provisioning, but afterwards,
    // Nexus should be calling the shots on "when to provision datasets".
    //
    // For test purposes, we have many situations where we want to carve up
    // zpools and datasets precisely for disk-based tests. As a result, we
    // *want* tests (namely, an entity outside of Nexus) to have this control.
    //
    // This test-based API provides one such mechanism of control.
    //
    // TODO: In the future, we *could* re-structure our tests to more rigorously
    // use the "RackInitializationRequest" handoff, but this would require
    // creating all our Zpools and Datasets before performing handoff to Nexus.
    // However, doing so would let us remove this test-only API.
