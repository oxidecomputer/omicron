#

# `AnyActor` includes both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
actor AnyActor {}

# An `AuthenticatedActor` has an identity in the system.  All of our operations
# today require that an actor be authenticated.
actor AuthenticatedActor {}

# For any resource, `actor` can perform action `action` on it if they're
# authenticated and their role(s) give them the corresponding permission on that
# resource.

#
# ROLES AND PERMISSIONS IN THE FLEET/SILO/PROJECT HIERARCHY
#
# We define the following permissions for most resources in the system:
#
# - "create_child": required to create child resources (of any type)
#
# - "list_children": required to list child resources (of all types) of a
#   resource
#
# - "modify": required to modify or delete a resource
#
# - "read": required to read a resource
#
# We define the following predefined roles for only a few high-level resources:
# the Fleet (see below), Silo, Organization, and Project.  The specific roles
# are oriented around intended use-cases:
#
# - "admin": has all permissions on the resource
#
# - "collaborator": has "read", "list_children", and "create_child", plus
#   the "admin" role for child resources.  The idea is that if you're an
#   Organization Collaborator, you have full control over the Projects within
#   the Organization, but you cannot modify or delete the Organization itself.
#
# - "viewer": has "read" and "list_children" on a resource
#
# Below the Project level, permissions are granted via roles at the Project
# level.  For example, for someone to be able to create, modify, or delete any
# Instances, they must be granted project.collaborator, which means they can
# create, modify, or delete _all_ resources in the Project.
#
# The complete set of predefined roles:
#
# - fleet.admin           (superuser for the whole system)
# - fleet.collaborator    (can manage Silos)
# - fleet.viewer          (can read most non-siloed resources in the system)
# - silo.admin            (superuser for the silo)
# - silo.collaborator     (can create and own Organizations)
# - silo.viewer           (can read most resources within the Silo)
# - organization.admin    (complete control over an organization)
# - organization.collaborator (can manage Projects)
# - organization.viewer   (can read most resources within the Organization)
# - project.admin         (complete control over a Project)
# - project.collaborator  (can manage all resources within the Project)
# - project.viewer        (can read most resources within the Project)
#
# Outside the Silo/Organization/Project hierarchy, we (currently) treat most
# resources as nested under Fleet or else a synthetic resource (see below).  We
# do not yet support role assignments on anything other than Fleet, Silo,
# Organization, or Project.
#

# "Fleet" is a global singleton representing the whole system.  The name comes
# from the idea described in RFD 24, but it's not quite right.  This probably
# should be more like "Region" or "AvailabilityZone".  The precise boundaries
# have not yet been figured out.

# As a special case, all authenticated users can read their own Silo.  That's
# not quite the same as having the "viewer" role.  For example, they cannot list
# Organizations in the Silo.
#
# One reason this is necessary is because if an unprivileged user tries to
# create an Organization using "POST /organizations", they should get back a 403
# (which implies they're able to see /organizations, which is essentially seeing
# the Silo itself) rather than a 404.  This behavior isn't a hard constraint
# (i.e., you could reasonably get a 404 for an API you're not allowed to call).
# Nor is the implementation (i.e., we could special-case this endpoint somehow).
# But granting this permission is the simplest way to keep this endpoint's
# behavior consistent with the rest of the API.
#
# This rule is also used to determine if a user can list the identity providers
# in the Silo (which they should be able to), since that's predicated on being
# able to read the Silo.
#
# It's unclear what else would break if users couldn't see their own Silo.
