//! Database connection pooling
// This whole thing is a placeholder for prototyping.
//
// TODO-robustness TODO-resilience We will want to carefully think about the
// connection pool that we use and its parameters.  It's not clear from the
// survey so far whether an existing module is suitable for our purposes.  See
// the Cueball Internals document for details on the sorts of behaviors we'd
// like here.  Even if by luck we stick with bb8, we definitely want to think
// through the various parameters.
//
// Notes about bb8's behavior:
// * When the database is completely offline, and somebody wants a connection,
//   it still waits for the connection timeout before giving up.  That seems
//   like not what we want.  (To be clear, this is a failure mode where we know
//   the database is offline, not one where it's partitioned and we can't tell.)
// * Although the `build_unchecked()` builder allows the pool to start up with
//   no connections established (good), it also _seems_ to not establish any
//   connections even when it could, resulting in a latency bubble for the first
//   operation after startup.  That's not what we're looking for.
//
// TODO-design Need TLS support (the types below hardcode NoTls).
