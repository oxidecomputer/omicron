/// SQL used to enable full table scans for the duration of the current

///
/// We normally disallow table scans in effort to identify scalability issues
/// during development.  There are some rare cases where we do want to do full
/// scans on small tables.  This SQL can be used to re-enable table scans for
/// the duration of the current transaction.
///
/// This should only be used when we know a table will be very small, it's not
/// paginated (if it were paginated, we could scan an index), and there's no
/// good way to limit the query based on an index.
///
/// This SQL appears to have no effect when used outside of a transaction.
/// That's intentional.  We do not want to use `SET` (rather than `SET LOCAL`)
/// here because that would change the behavior for any code that happens to use
/// the same pooled connection after this SQL gets run.
///
/// **BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS.**
