= Benchmarks

This directory contains benchmarks for database queries.

These queries can be run with:

[source,bash]
----
cargo bench -p nexus-db-queries
----

Additionally, the "SHOW_CONTENTION" environment variable can be set to display
extra data from CockroachDB tables about contention statistics, if they
are available.
