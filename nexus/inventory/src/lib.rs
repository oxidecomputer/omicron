//! Omicron component inventory
//!
//! This module provides [`Collector`], an interface for collecting a complete
//! hardware/software inventory in a running Omicron deployment
//!
//! This is really just the collection part.  For separation of concerns, this
//! module doesn't know anything about storing these collections into the
//! database.  That's provided by the datastore.  The types associated with
//! collections are in `nexus_types::inventory` so they can be shared with other
//! parts of Nexus (like the datastore).
//!
//! This module lives inside Nexus but it has few dependencies on other parts of
//! Nexus.  It could be incorporated into other components.  (The corresponding
//! types in `nexus_types` might have to move, too)
