//! Background task that sends HTTP requests to webhook receiver endpoints for
//! active webhook deliveries.
//!
//! This task reads [`WebhookDelivery`] records from the database (created by the
//! [`alert_dispatcher`] task) and sends HTTP requests to the receivers for
//! those records.  The deliverator is responsible for recording the status of
//! each of these attempts, and for retrying failed attempts as needed.  For
//! an overview of all the components of the webhook subsystem, their roles, and
//! how they fit together, refer to the comments in the [`app::webhook`] module.
//!
//! The `webhook_deliverator` background tasks in multiple Nexus instances
//! coordinate between each other using a simple advisory lease system to avoid
//! attempting to deliver the same event to the same receiver simultaneously.
//! Since webhooks guarantee at-least-once delivery, this mechanism is not
//! required for correctness; instead, it serves only to reduce unnecessary work
//! by avoiding duplicate delivereis when possible.  A delivery is leased by
//! setting the `deliverator_id` field to the leasing Nexus' Omicron zone UUID
//! and the `time_leased` field to the current timestamp.  When querying the
//! database for deliveries in need of deliverating, a delivery is selected if
//! its `deliverator_id` field is unset OR if a configurable timeout period has
//! elapsed since its `time_leased` timestamp.  This way, should a Nexus
//! instance die or get stuck in the midst of a delivery, its lease will
//! eventually time out, and other Nexii will attempt that delivery.

// The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed sub-category. He's got
// esprit up to here. Right now he is preparing to carry out his third mission
// of the night. His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very
// light out of the air. A bullet will bounce off its arachno-fiber weave like a
// wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a
// breeze through a freshly napalmed forest. Where his body has bony
// extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello,
// protects like a stack of telephone books.
//
// When they gave him the job, they gave him a gun. The Deliverator never deals
// in cash, but someone might come after him anywayâ€“might want his car, or his
// cargo. The gun is tiny, aero-styled, lightweight, the kind of a gun a
// fashion designer would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times
// the velocity of an SR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have
// to plug it in to the cigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.
//
// The Deliverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear. He pulled it once
// in Gila Highlands. Some punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted
// themselves a delivery, and they didn't want to pay for it. Thought they would
// impress the Deliverator with a baseball bat. The Deliverator took out his
// gun, centered its laser doo-hickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired
// it. The recoil was immense, as though the weapon had blown up in his hand.
// The middle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust
// accelerating in all directions like a bursting star. Punk ended up holding
// this bat handle with milky smoke pouring out the end. Stupid look on his
// face. Didn't get nothing but trouble from the Deliverator.
//
// Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment and
// relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been
// his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren't afraid of
// the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords need no
// demonstration.
//
// The Deliverator's car has enough potential energy packed into its batteries
// to fire a pound of bacon into the Asteroid Belt. Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb
// beater, the Deliverator's car unloads that power through gaping, gleaming,
// polished sphincters. When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens.
// You want to talk contact patches? Your car's tires have tiny contact patches,
// talk to the asphalt in four places the size of your tongue. The Deliverator's
// car has big sticky tires with contact patches the size of a fat lady's
// thighs. The Deliverator is in touch with the road, starts like a bad day,
// stops on a peseta.
//
// Why is the Deliverator so equipped? Because people rely on him. He is a role
// model.
