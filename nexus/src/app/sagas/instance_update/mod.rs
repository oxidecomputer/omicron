//! Instance Update Saga
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! The state of a VM instance, as understood by Nexus, consists of a
//! combination of database tables:
//!
//! - The `instance` table, owned exclusively by Nexus itself, represents the
//!   user-facing "logical" VM instance.
//! - The `vmm` table, which represents a "physical" Propolis VMM process on
//!   which a running instance is incarnated.
//! - The `migration` table, which represents the state of an in-progress live
//!   migration of an instance between two VMMs.
//!
//! When an instance is incarnated on a sled, the `propolis_id` field in an
//! `instance` record contains a UUID foreign key into the `vmm` table that
//! points to the `vmm` record for the Propolis process on which the instance is
//! currently running. If an instance is undergoing live migration, its record
//! additionally contains a `dst_propolis_id` foreign key pointing at the `vmm`
//! row representing the *target* Propolis process that it is migrating to, and
//! a `migration_id` foreign key into the `migration` table record tracking the
//! state of that migration.
//!
//! Sled-agents report the state of the VMMs they manage to Nexus. This occurs
//! when a VMM state transition occurs and the sled-agent *pushes* an update to
//! Nexus' `cpapi_instances_put` internal API endpoint, when a Nexus'
//! `instance-watcher` background task *pulls* instance states from sled-agents
//! periodically, or as the return value of an API call from Nexus to a
//! sled-agent. When a Nexus receives a new [`SledInstanceState`] from a
//! sled-agent through any of these mechanisms, the Nexus will write any changed
//! state to the `vmm` and/or `migration` tables directly on behalf of the
//! sled-agent.
//!
//! Although Nexus is technically the party responsible for the database query
//! that writes VMM and migration state updates received from sled-agent, it is
//! the sled-agent that *logically* "owns" these records. A row in the `vmm`
//! table represents a particular Propolis process running on a particular sled,
//! and that sled's sled-agent is the sole source of truth for that process. The
//! generation number for a `vmm` record is the property of the sled-agent
//! responsible for that VMM. Similarly, a `migration` record has separate
//! generation numbers for the source and target VMM states, which are owned by
//! the sled-agents responsible for the source and target Propolis processes,
//! respectively. If a sled-agent pushes a state update to a particular Nexus
//! instance and that Nexus fails to write the state to the database, that isn't
//! the end of the world: the sled-agent can simply retry with a different
//! Nexus, and the generation number, which is incremented exclusively by the
//! sled-agent, ensures that state changes are idempotent and ordered. If a
//! faulty Nexus were to return 200 OK to a sled-agent's call to
//! `cpapi_instances_put` but choose to simply eat the received instance state
//! update rather than writing it to the database, even *that* wouldn't
//! necessarily mean that the state change was gone forever: the
//! `instance-watcher` background task on another Nexus instance would
//! eventually poll the sled-agent's state and observe any changes that were
//! accidentally missed. This is all very neat and tidy, and we should feel
//! proud of ourselves for having designed such a nice little system.
//!
//! Unfortunately, when we look beyond the `vmm` and `migration` tables, things
//! rapidly become interesting (in the "may you live in interesting times"
//! sense). The `instance` record *cannot* be owned exclusively by anyone. The
//! logical instance state it represents is a gestalt that may consist of state
//! that exists in multiple VMM processes on multiple sleds, as well as
//! control-plane operations triggered by operator inputs and performed by
//! multiple Nexus instances. This is, as they say, "hairy". The neat and tidy
//! little state updates published by sled-agents to Nexus in the previous
//! paragraph may, in some cases, represent a state transition that also
//! requires changes to the `instance` table: for instance, a live migration may
//! have completed, necessitating a change in the instance's `propolis_id` to
//! point to the new VMM.
//!
//! Oh, and one other thing: the `instance` table record in turn logically
//! "owns" other resources, such as the virtual-provisioning counters that
//! represent rack-level resources allocated to the instance, and the instance's
//! network configuration. When the instance's state changes, these resources
//! owned by the instance may also need to be updated, such as changing the
//! network configuration to point at an instance's new home after a successful
//! migration, or deallocating virtual provisioning counters when an instance is
//! destroyed. Naturally, these updates must also be performed reliably and
//! inconsistent states must be avoided.
//!
//! Thus, we arrive here, at the instance-update saga.
//!
//! ## Theory of Operation
//!
//! In order to ensure that changes to the state of an instance are handled
//! reliably, we require that all multi-stage operations on an instance ---
//! i.e., operations which cannot be done atomically in a single database query
//! --- on an instance are performed  by a saga. The following sagas currently
//! touch the `instance` record:
//!
//! - [`instance_start`]
//! - [`instance_migrate`]
//! - [`instance_delete`]
//! - `instance_update` (this saga)
//!
//! For most of these sagas, the instance state machine itself guards against
//! potential race conditions. By considering the valid and invalid flows
//! through an instance's state machine, we arrive at some ground rules:
//!
//! - The `instance_migrate` and `instance_delete` sagas will only modify the
//!   instance record if the instance *has* an active Propolis ID.
//! - The `instance_start` and instance_delete` sagas will only modify the
//!   instance record if the instance does *not* have an active VMM.
//! - The presence of a migration ID prevents an `instance_migrate` saga from
//!   succeeding until the current migration is resolved (either completes or
//!   fails).
//! - Only the `instance_start` saga can set the instance's *active* Propolis
//!   ID, and it can only do this if there is currently no active Propolis.
//! - Only the `instance_migrate` saga can set the instance's *target* Propolis
//!   ID and migration ID, and it can only do that if these fields are unset, or
//!   were left behind by a failed `instance_migrate` saga unwinding.
//! - Only the `instance_update` saga can unset a migration ID and target
//!   Propolis ID, which it will do when handling an update from sled-agent that
//!   indicates that a migration has succeeded or failed.
//! - Only the `instance_update` saga can unset an instance's active Propolis
//!   ID, which it will do when handling an update from sled-agent that
//!   indicates that the VMM has been destroyed (peacefully or violently).
//!
//! For the most part, this state machine prevents race conditions where
//! multiple sagas mutate the same fields in the instance record, because the
//! states from which a particular transition may start limited. However, this
//! is not the case for the `instance-update` saga, which may need to run any
//! time a sled-agent publishes a new instance state. Therefore, this saga
//! ensures mutual exclusion using one of the only distributed locking schemes
//! in Omicron: the "instance updater lock".
//!
//! ### The Instance-Updater Lock, or, "Distributed RAII"
//!
//! Distributed locks [are scary][dist-locking]. One of the *scariest* things
//! about distributed locks is that a process can die[^1] while holding a lock,
//! which results in the protected resource (in this case, the `instance`
//! record) being locked forever.[^2] It would be good for that to not happen.
//! Fortunately, *if* (and only if) we promise to *only* ever acquire the
//! instance-updater lock inside of a saga, we can guarantee forward progress:
//! should a saga fail while holding the lock, it will unwind into a reverse
//! action that releases the lock. This is essentially the distributed
//! equivalent to holding a RAII guard in a Rust program: if the thread holding
//! the lock panics, it unwinds its stack, drops the [`std::sync::MutexGuard`],
//! and the rest of the system is not left in a deadlocked state. As long as we
//! ensure that the instance-updater lock is only ever acquired by sagas, and
//! that any saga holding a lock will reliably release it when it unwinds, we're
//! ... *probably* ... okay.
//!
//! When an `instance-update` saga is started, it attempts to [acquire the
//! updater lock][instance_updater_lock]. If the lock is already held by another
//! update saga, then the update saga completes immediately. Otherwise, the saga
//! then queries CRDB for the current state of the `instance` record, the active
//! and migration-target `vmm` records (if any exist), and the current
//! `migration` record (if one exists). This snapshot represents the state from
//! which the update will be applied, and must be read only after locking the
//! instance to ensure that it cannot race with another saga.
//!
//! This is where another of this saga's weird quirks shows up: the shape of the
//! saga DAG we wish to execute depends on this instance, active VMM, target
//! VMM, and migration. But, because the precondition for the saga state may
//! only be read once the lock is acquired, and --- as we discussed above ---
//! the instance-updater lock may only ever be acquired within a saga, we arrive
//! at a bit of a weird impasse: we can't determine what saga DAG to build
//! without looking at the initial state, but we can't load the state until
//! we've already started a saga. To solve this, we've split this saga into two
//! pieces: the first, `start-instance-update`, is a very small saga that just
//! tries to lock the instance, and upon doing so, loads the instance state from
//! the database and prepares and executes the "real" instance update saga. Once
//! the "real" saga starts, it "inherits" the lock from the start saga by
//! performing [the SQL equivalent equivalent of a compare-and-swap
//! operation][instance_updater_inherit_lock] with its own UUID.
//!
//! The DAG for the "real" update saga depends on the state read within the
//! lock, and since the lock was never released, that state remains valid for
//! its execution. As the final action of the update saga, the instance record's
//! new runtime state is written back to the database and the lock is released,
//! in a [single atomic operation][instance_updater_unlock]. Should the update
//! saga fail, it will release the inherited lock. And, if the unwinding update
//! saga unwinds into the start saga, that's fine, because a double-unlock is
//! prevented by the saga ID having changed in the "inherit lock" operation.
//!
//! ### Interaction With Other Sagas
//!
//! The instance-updater lock only provides mutual exclusion with regards to
//! *other `instance-update` sagas*. It does *not* prevent modifications to the
//! instance record by other sagas, such as `instance-start`,
//! `instance-migrate`, and `instance-delete`. Instead, mutual exclusion between
//! the `instance-update` saga and `instance-start` and `instance-delete` sagas
//! is ensured by the actual state of the instance record, as discussed above:
//! start and delete sagas can be started only when the instance has no active
//! VMM, and the `instance-update` saga will only run when an instance *does*
//! have an active VMM that has transitioned to a state where it must be
//! unlinked from the instance. The update saga unlinks the VMM from the
//! instance record as its last action, which allows the instance to be a valid
//! target for a start or delete saga.
//!
//! On the other hand, an `instance-migrate` saga can, potentially, mutate the
//! instance record while an update saga is running, if it attempts to start a
//! migration while an update is still being processed. If the migrate saga
//! starts during an update and completes before the update saga, the update
//! saga writing back an updated instance state to the instance record could
//! result in an [ABA problem]-like issue, where the changes made by the migrate
//! saga are clobbered by the update saga. These issues are instead guarded
//! against by the instance record's state generation number: the update saga
//! determines the generation for the updated instance record by incrementing
//! the generation number observed when the initial state for the update is
//! read. The query that writes back the instance's runtime state fails if the
//! generation number has changed since the state was read at the beginning of
//! the saga, which causes the saga to unwind. An unwinding saga activates the
//! `instance-updater` background task, which may in turn start a new saga if
//! the instance's current state still requires an update.
//!
//! To avoid unnecessarily changing an instance's state generation and
//! invalidating in-progress update sagas, unwinding `instance-start` and
//! `instance-migrate` sagas don't remove the VMMs and migrations they create
//! from the instance's `propolis_id`, `target_propolis_id`, and `migration_id`
//! fields. Instead, they transition the `vmm` records to
//! [`VmmState::SagaUnwound`], which is treated as equivalent to having no VMM
//! in that position by other instances of those sagas.
//!
//! ### Avoiding Missed Updates, or, "The `InstanceRuntimeState` Will Always Get Through"
//!
//! The lock operation we've described above is really more of a "try-lock"
//! operation: if the lock is already held, the saga trying to acquire it just
//! ends immediately, rather than waiting for the lock to be released. This begs
//! the question, "what happens if an instance update comes in while the lock is
//! held?" Do we just...leave it on the floor? Wasn't the whole point of this
//! Rube Goldberg mechanism of sagas to *prevent* instance state changes from
//! being missed?
//!
//! We solve this using an ~~even more layers of complexity~~defense-in-depth
//! approach. Together, a number of mechanisms exist to ensure that (a) an
//! instance whose VMM and migration states require an update saga will always
//! have an update saga run eventually, and (b) update sagas are run in as
//! timely a manner as possible.
//!
//! The first of these ~~layers of nonsense~~redundant systems to prevent missed
//! updates is perhaps the simplest one: _avoiding unnecessary update sagas_.
//! The `cpapi_instances_put` API endpoint and instance-watcher background tasks
//! handle changes to VMM and migration states by calling the
//! [`notify_instance_updated`] method, which writes the new states to the
//! database and (potentially) starts an update saga. Naively, this method would
//! *always* start an update saga, but remember that --- as we discussed
//! [above](#background) --- many VMM/migration state changes don't actually
//! require modifying the instance record. For example, if an instance's VMM
//! transitions from [`VmmState::Starting`] to [`VmmState::Running`], that
//! changes the instance's externally-visible effective state, but it does *not*
//! require an instance record update. By not starting an update saga unless one
//! is actually required, we reduce updater lock contention, so that the lock is
//! less likely to be held when VMM and migration states that actually *do*
//! require an update saga are published. The [`update_saga_needed`] function in
//! this module contains the logic for determining whether an update saga is
//! required.
//!
//! The second mechanism for ensuring updates are performed in a timely manner
//! is what I'm calling _saga chaining_. When the final action in an
//! instance-update saga writes back the instance record and releases the
//! updater lock, it will then perform a second query to read the instance, VMM,
//! and migration records. If the current state of the instance indicates that
//! another update saga is needed, then the completing saga will execute a new
//! start saga as its final action.
//!
//! The last line of defense is the `instance-updater` background task. This
//! task periodically queries the database to list instances which require
//! update sagas (either their active VMM is `Destroyed` or their active
//! migration has terminated) and are not currently locked by another update
//! saga. A new update saga is started for any such instances found. Because
//! this task runs periodically, it ensures that eventually, an update saga will
//! be started for any instance that requires one.[^3]
//!
//! The background task ensures that sagas are started eventually, but because
//! it only runs occasionally, update sagas started by it may be somewhat
//! delayed. To improve the timeliness of update sagas, we will also explicitly
//! activate the background task at any point where we know that an update saga
//! *should* run but we were not able to run it. If an update saga cannot be
//! started, whether by [`notify_instance_updated`], a `start-instance-update`
//! saga attempting to start its real saga, or an `instance-update` saga
//! chaining into a new one as its last action, the `instance-watcher`
//! background task is activated. Similarly, when a `start-instance-update` saga
//! fails to acquire the lock and exits, it activates the background task as
//! well. This ensures that we will attempt the update again.
//!
//! ### On Unwinding
//!
//! Typically, when a Nexus saga unwinds, each node's reverse action undoes any
//! changes made by the forward action. The `instance-update` saga, however, is
//! a bit different: most of its nodes don't have reverse actions that undo the
//! action they performed. This is because, unlike `instance-start`,
//! `instance-migrate`, or `instance-delete`, the instance-update saga is
//! **not** attempting to perform a state change for the instance that was
//! requested by a user. Instead, it is attempting to update the
//! database and networking configuration *to match a state change that has
//! already occurred.*
//!
//! Consider the following: if we run an `instance-start` saga, and the instance
//! cannot actually be started, of course we would want the unwinding saga to
//! undo any database changes it has made, because the instance was not actually
//! started. Failing to undo those changes when an `instance-start` saga unwinds
//! would mean the database is left in a state that does not reflect reality, as
//! the instance was not actually started. On the other hand, suppose an
//! instance's active VMM shuts down and we start an `instance-update` saga to
//! move it to the `Destroyed` state. Even if some action along the way fails, the
//! instance is still `Destroyed``; that state transition has *already happened*
//! on the sled, and unwinding the update saga cannot and should not un-destroy
//! the VMM.
//!
//! So, unlike other sagas, we want to leave basically anything we've
//! successfully done in place when unwinding, because even if the update is
//! incomplete, we have still brought Nexus' understanding of the instance
//! *closer* to reality. If there was something we weren't able to do, one of
//! the instance-update-related RPWs[^rpws] will start a new update saga to try
//! it again. Because saga actions are idempotent, attempting to do something
//! that was already successfully performed a second time isn't a problem, and
//! we don't need to undo it.
//!
//! The one exception to this is, as [discussed
//! above](#the-instance-updater-lock-or-distributed-raii), unwinding instance
//! update sagas MUST always release the instance-updater lock, so that a
//! subsequent saga can update the instance. Thus, the saga actions which lock
//! the instance have reverse actions that release the updater lock.

    // will ruin the instance record forever and it will only be able to be
    // removed by manual operator intervention. That would be...not great.

    //
