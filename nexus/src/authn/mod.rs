//! Authentication facilities
//!
//! In the limit, we'll want all operations in Nexus to have an associated
//! authentication/authorization context that describes who (or what) is doing
//! the operation and what privileges they have.
//!
//! This module includes generic, HTTP-agnostic facilities for representing who
//! or what is authenticated and why an authentication attempt failed.
//!
//! The [`external`] submodule provides an [`external::Authenticator`] interface
//! that will eventually authenticate requests using standard external
//! authentication mechanisms like HTTP signatures or OAuth.
//!
//! In the future, we can add other submodules for other kinds of
//! authentication.  For example, if we use macaroons for internal authn, we
//! could have a different `InternalHttpnAuthenticator` that validates the
//! macaroons.   Other operations may not be associated with HTTP requests at
//! all (like saga recovery, health checking, or fault response), but we may
//! still want them to carry information about what's authenticated and what
//! privileges it has.  These submodules might provide different mechanisms for
//! authentication, but they'd all produce the same [`Context`] struct.

//       +-----|---|----|-------------------- prefix used for all reserved uuids
//             |   |    |                     (looks a bit like "oxide")
//             +---|----|-------------------- says what kind of resource it is
//                 |    |                     ("05e4" looks a bit like "user")
//                 +----|-------------------- v4
//                      +-------------------- variant 1 (most common for v4)
//
// This way, the uuids stand out a bit.  It's not clear if this convention will
// be very useful, but it beats a random uuid.  (Is it safe to do this?  Well,
// these are valid v4 uuids, and they're as unlikely to collide with a future
// uuid as any random uuid is.)
