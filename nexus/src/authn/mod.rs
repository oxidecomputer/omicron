//! Authentication facilities
//!
//! In the limit, we'll want all operations in Nexus to have an associated
//! authentication/authorization context that describes who (or what) is doing
//! the operation and what privileges they have.
//!
//! This module includes generic, HTTP-agnostic facilities for representing who
//! or what is authenticated and why an authentication attempt failed.
//!
//! The [`external`] submodule provides an [`external::Authenticator`] interface
//! that will eventually authenticate requests using standard external
//! authentication mechanisms like HTTP signatures or OAuth.
//!
//! In the future, we can add other submodules for other kinds of
//! authentication.  For example, if we use macaroons for internal authn, we
//! could have a different `InternalHttpnAuthenticator` that validates the
//! macaroons.   Other operations may not be associated with HTTP requests at
//! all (like saga recovery, health checking, or fault response), but we may
//! still want them to carry information about what's authenticated and what
//! privileges it has.  These submodules might provide different mechanisms for
//! authentication, but they'd all produce the same [`Context`] struct.
