//! Role lookup
//!
//! For important background, see the [`crate::authz`] module documentation.  We
//! said there that in evaluating the authorization decision, Oso winds up
//! checking whether the actor has one of many different roles on many different
//! resources.  It's essentially looking for specific rows in the
//! "role_assignment" table.
//!
//! To achieve this, before calling into Oso, we load _all_ of the roles that
//! the actor has on this resource _or any related resource_ that might affect
//! the authorization decision.  In practice, that means if the user is trying
//! to modify a Project, we'll fetch all the roles they have on that Project or
//! its parent Organization or the parent Fleet.  This isn't as large as it
//! might sound, since the hierarchy is not _that_ deep, but we do have to make
//! multiple database queries to load all this.  This is all done by
//! [`load_roles_for_resource_tree`].
//!
//! Once we've got the complete list of roles, we include that in the data
//! structure we pass into Oso.   When it asks whether an actor has a role on a
//! resource, we just look it up in our data structure.  In principle, we could
//! skip the prefetching and look up the specific roles we need when Oso asks
//! that question.  This might let us short-circuit the role fetching, since we
//! might find we don't even need to check a parent's roles.  There are two
//! problems with this: first, Oso will separately ask about every related role
//! for a given resource.  Is this person a project admin?  Are they a
//! collaborator?  We want to collapse these into the same database query --
//! otherwise, this approach will result in _more_ database queries, not fewer.
//! Second, our database operations are async, but Oso is synchronous.  We're
//! doing authorization in the context of whatever task is handling this
//! request, and we don't want that thread to block while we hit the database.
//! Both of these issues could be addressed with considerably more work.
