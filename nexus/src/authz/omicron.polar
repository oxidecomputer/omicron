# Permissions and predefined roles for resources in the
# Fleet/Silo/Organization/Project hierarchy
#
# For now, we define the following permissions for most resources in the system:
#
# - "create_child": required to create child resources.
#
# - "list_children": required to list children (of all types) of a resources
#
# - "modify": required to modify or delete a resource or any of its children
#
# - "read": required to read a resource
#
# We define the following predefined roles for only a few high-level resources:
#
# - "admin": has all permissions on the resource
#
# - "collaborator": has "list_children" and "create_$child" for all children.
#   They'll inherit the "admin" role for any resources that they create.
#
# - "viewer": has "read" and "list_children" on a resource
#
# Below the project level, permissions are granted at the Project level.  For
# example, for someone to be able to create, modify, or delete any Instances,
# they must be granted project.collaborator, which means they can create,
# modify, or delete _all_ resources in the Project.
#
# The complete set of predefined roles:
#
# - fleet.admin           (superuser for the whole system)
# - fleet.collaborator    (can create and own silos)
# - fleet.viewer          (can read fleet-wide data)
# - silo.admin            (superuser for the silo)
# - silo.collaborator     (can create and own orgs)
# - silo.viewer           (can read silo-wide data)
# - organization.admin    (complete control over an organization)
# - organization.collaborator (can create, modify, and delete projects)
# - project.admin         (complete control over a project)
# - project.collaborator  (can create, modify, and delete all resources within
#                         the project, but cannot modify or delete the project
#                         itself)
# - project.viewer        (can see everything in the project, but cannot modify
#                         anything)
#

# At the top level is the "Fleet" resource.
