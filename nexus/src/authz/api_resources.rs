//! Authz types for resources in the API hierarchy

// Most of the types here are used in the Polar configuration, which means they
// must impl [`oso::PolarClass`].  There is a derive(PolarClass), but it's
// pretty limited: It also doesn't let you define methods.  We
// may want to define our own macro(s) to avoid having to impl this by hand
// everywhere.
//
// Many of these are newtypes that wrap existing types, either simple types from
// Nexus (like `authn::Context`) or database model types.  The main reason is
// that [`Oso::is_allowed()`] consumes owned values, not references.  Consumers
// that want to do an authz check almost always want to keep using the thing
// they had.  We could instead require that the database model types all impl
// `Clone`, impl `PolarClass` on those types, and then just copy them when we
// pass them to `is_allowed()`.  Using newtypes is a way to capture just the
// parts we need for authorization.
