     * We want to update a row only if it meets some preconditions.  One
     * traditional way to do that is to begin a transaction, SELECT [the row]
     * FOR UPDATE, examine it here in the client, then decide whether to UPDATE
     * it.  The SELECT FOR UPDATE locks the row in the database until the
     * transaction commits or aborts.  This causes other clients that want to
     * modify the row to block.  This works okay, but it means locks are held
     * and clients blocked for an entire round-trip to the database, plus
     * processing time here.
     *
     * Another approach is to simply UPDATE the row and include the
     * preconditions directly in the WHERE clause.  This keeps database lock
     * hold time to a minimum (no round trip with locks held).  However, all you
     * know after that is whether the row was updated.  If it wasn't, you don't
     * know if it's because the row wasn't present or it didn't meet the
     * preconditions.
     *
     * One could begin a transaction, perform the UPDATE with preconditions in
     * the WHERE clause, then SELECT the row, then COMMIT.  If we could convince
     * ourselves that the UPDATE and SELECT see the same snapshot of the data,
     * this would be an improvement -- provided that we can send all four
     * statements (BEGIN, UPDATE, SELECT, COMMIT) as a single batch and still
     * see the results of the UPDATE and SELECT.  It's not clear if this is
     * possible using the PostgreSQL wire protocol, but it doesn't seem to be
     * exposed from the tokio_postgres client.  If these aren't sent in one
     * batch, you have the same problem as above: locks held for an entire
     * round-trip.
     *
     * While somewhat complicated at first glance, the SQL below allows us to
     * correctly perform the update, minimize lock hold time, and still
     * distinguish the cases we're interested in: successful update, failure
     * because the row was in the wrong state, failure because the row doesn't
     * exist
     *
     * The query starts with a CTE that SELECTs the row we're going to update.
     * This includes the identifying columns plus any extra columns that the
     * caller asked for.  (These are usually the columns associated with the
     * preconditions.)  For example:
     *
     *     SELECT  id, state FROM Instance WHERE id = $1
     *             ^^^  ^^^                      ^^

     *                         (scope key  + item key columns)

///
//
// It's worth describing this process in more detail from the perspective of our
// caller.  We'll consider the case of a saga that creates a new Instance.
// TODO This might belong in docs for the saga instead.
//
//
// EASY CASE
//
// If we do a simple INSERT, and that succeeds -- great.  That's the common case
// and it's easy.
//
//
// ERROR: CONFLICT ON INSTANCE ID
//
// What if we get a conflict error on the instance id?  Since the id is unique
// to this saga, we must assume that means that we're being invoked a second
// time after a previous one successfully updated the database.  That means one
// of two things: (1) a previous database update succeeded, but something went
// wrong (e.g., the SEC crashed) before the saga could persistently record that
// fact; or (2) a second instance of the action is concurrently running with
// this one and already completed its database update.  ((2) is only possible
// if, after evaluating use cases like this, we decide that it's okay to _allow_
// two instances of the same action to run concurrently in the case of a
// partition among SECs or the like.  We would only do that if it's clear that
// the action implementations can always handle this.)
//
// We opt to handle this by ignoring the conflict and always fetching the
// corresponding row in the table.  In the common case, we'll find our own row.
// In the conflict case, we'll find the pre-existing row.  In that latter case,
// the caller will verify that it looks the way we expect it to look (same
// "name", parameters, generation number, etc.).  It should always match what we
// would have inserted.  Having verified that, we can simply act as though we
// inserted it ourselves.  In both cases (1) and (2) above, this action will
// complete successfully and the saga can proceed.  In (2), the SEC may have to
// deal with the fact that the same action completed twice, but it doesn't have
// to _do_ anything about it (i.e., invoke an undo action).  That said, if a
// second SEC did decide to unwind the saga and undo this action, things get
// more complicated.  It would be nice if the framework guaranteed that (2)
// wasn't the case.
//
//
// ERROR: CONFLICT ON INSTANCE ID, MISSING ROW
//
// What if we get a conflict, fetch the corresponding row, and find none?  We
// should make this impossible in a correct system.  The only two things that
// might plausibly do this are (A) the undo action for this action, and (B) an
// actual instance delete operation.  We can disallow (B) by not allowing
// anything to delete an instance whose create saga never finished (indicated by
// the state in the Instance row).  Is there any implementation of sagas that
// would allow us to wind up in case (A)?  Again, if SECs went split-brain
// because one of them got to this point in the saga, hit the easy case, then
// became partitioned from the rest of the world, and then a second SEC picked
// up the saga and reran this action, and then the first saga encountered some
// _other_ failure that triggered a saga unwind, resulting in the undo action
// for this step completing, and then the second SEC winds up in this state.
// One way to avoid this would be to have the undo action, rather than deleting
// the instance record, marking the row with a state indicating it is dead (or
// maybe never even alive).  Something needs to clean these records up, but
// that's needed anyway for any sort of deleted record.
//
//
// COMBINING THE TWO QUERIES
//
// Since the case where we successfully insert the record is expected to be so
// common, we could use a RETURNING clause and only do a subsequent SELECT on
// conflict.  This would bifurcate the code paths in a way that means we'll
// almost never wind up testing the conflict path.  We could add this
// optimization if/when we find that the extra query is a problem.
//
// Relatedly, we could put the INSERT and SELECT queries into a transaction.
// This isn't necessary for our purposes.
//
//
// PROPOSED APPROACH
//
// Putting this all together, we arrive at the approach here:
//
//   ACTION:
//   - INSERT INTO Instance ... ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING.
//   - SELECT * from Instance WHERE id = ...
//
//   UNDO ACTION:
//   - UPDATE Instance SET state = deleted AND time_deleted = ... WHERE
//     id = ...;
//     (this will update 0 or 1 row, and it doesn't matter to us which)
//
// There are two more considerations:
//
// Does this work?  Recall that sagas say that the effect of the sequence:
//
//   start action (1)
//   start + finish action (2)
//   start + finish undo action
//   finish action (1)
//
// must be the same as if action (1) had never happened.  This is true of the
// proposed approach.  That is, no matter what parts of the "action (1)" happen
// before or after the undo action finishes, the net result on the _database_
// will be as if "action (1)" had never occurred.
//
//
// ERROR: CONFLICT ON NAME
//
// All of the above describes what happens when there's a conflict on "id",
// which is unique to this saga.  It's also possible that there would be a
// conflict on the unique (project_id, name) index.  In that case, we just want
// to fail right away -- the whole saga is going to fail with a user error.
