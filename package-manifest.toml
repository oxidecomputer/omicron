# Omicron Packages
# ----------------
#
# The Oxide control plane software (Omicron) is built and assembled into
# *packages* that can be shipped to Oxide systems and deployed.  Note that
# "package" here is an Omicron concept.  There is overlap with Rust packages,
# but they're not the same thing.  This "package" has nothing to do with illumos
# IPS packages or any other kind of operating system or ecosystem package.
#
# Four kinds of packages are supported, as determined by their _source_ type:
#
# (1) "local": packages whose contents come from any combination of files in the
#     current directory, blobs stored in S3, or the result of building a Rust
#     package in the current workspace
#
#     If the package involves building a Rust package in the same workspace,
#     then the Rust package *must* have the same name as the Omicron package.
#
# (2) "prebuilt": packages whose contents come wholesale from the output of a
#     buildomat job
#
# (3) "composite": packages whose contents come from combining the results of
#     one or more other packages
#
# (4) "manual": packages whose contents are assumed to be put into place by hand
#
#     Manual packages are intended for developers (in development) to override
#     the source of prebuilt packages with custom contents.
#
# For more on these, see the documentation on
# `omicron_zone_package::PackageSource`.
#
# This file defines all of the packages that make up Omicron and how to build
# each one.  `omicron-package` and `thing-flinger` process this file to build
# and deploy these packages.
