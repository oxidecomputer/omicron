# Please read before adding a new dependency!
#
# cargo xtask is used for many developer flows, and it is important for devx
# that it be quick to build. If a particular task needs many dependencies,
# consider moving it out into a binary crate and building that separately.
# Additional binaries generally mean that you only pay for what you need.
#
# For example, xtask-downloader is a separate binary because it requires many
# additional dependencies, like `reqwest`, `tar`, and `tokio`.
#
# The combinatorial explosion of features that would ordinarily happen is not
# an issue for omicron due to the workspace-hack crate. (For build speed
# reasons, `xtask` does *not* depend on `omicron-workspace-hack`. But the
# downstream binaries do depend on it.)
