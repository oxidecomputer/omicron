/// Runs a REPL using stdin/stdout

/// Behavior:
///
/// - Each line is treated as a command.  It's parsed as a `C`, which is of type
///   `clap::Parser`.  In other words: you use `clap` to define the commands
///   supported in your REPL.
/// - On failure to parse each line as a `C` command, a usage message is
///   printed.
/// - '#' is a comment character.  In each line, the first '#' and any
///   subsequent characters are ignored.
/// - `run_one` is invoked for each successfully parsed command.
///   - On success with `Some(string)`, the string is printed, followed by a
///     newline.
///   - On success with `None`, nothing is printed.
///   - On failure, the error and its cause chain are printed.
///
/// Limitations:
///
/// - Arguments are currently split on whitespace, so commands, options, and
///   arguments cannot have whitespace in them.
