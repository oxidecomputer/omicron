= protostar

[TIP]
A protostar is one of the earliest stages in a star's lifecycle, which gathers
mass before eventually igniting and becoming a main-sequence star. When this
happens, a star generates energy via fusion.

`protostar` is an implementation of the `fusion` interface which is designed to
execute on a real Helios system. This interface, while necessary, is notoriously
difficult to test. Although we encourage the addition of arbitrary host-interfacing
calls here, we recommend the following:

1. Keeping them as simple as possible, with the understanding that code within
this crate can only sufficiently be tested via end-to-end tests.
2. When adding new interfaces to the host, access them via the `fusion` interface,
and provide a "fake" implementation in the `tokamak` crate. This will allow callers
integrating with host interfaces to write tests, and simulate the underlying system
behaviors.
