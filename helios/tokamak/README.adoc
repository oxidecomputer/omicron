= tokamak

[TIP]
A tokamak is a magnetic confinement fusion device which can be used to
produce nuclear fusion reactions. In other words, they're one of our tools for
creating a "artificial sun".

`tokamak` is a toolkit implementing the `fusion` interface which allows callers
to run an emulated Helios system. It does not intend to operate as a virtual
machine, nor run any real workloads: the purpose of this crate is to give
callers an opportunity to test very specific interfaces against the underlying
host, without actually requiring a host that has undergone that behavior.
