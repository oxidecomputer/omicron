This directory describes various interfaces for acting upon a Helios system.

* `fusion` describes an interface for interacting with the underlying OS.
* `tokamak` provides a fake implementation of `fusion` - not enough
to be virtualized, but enough to test code depending on `fusion` under test.
* `protostar` provides a real implementation of `fusion`, which should actually
make calls to the underlying OS.
