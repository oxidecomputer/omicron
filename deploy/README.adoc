Omicron is a complex piece of software consisting of many build and install-time dependencies. It's
intended to run primarily on illumos based systems, and as such is built to use runtime facilities
of illumos, such as https://illumos.org/man/5/smf[SMF]. Furthermore, Omicron is fundamentally a
distributed system, with its components intended to run on multiple servers communicating over the
network. In order to secure the system, certain cryptographic primitives, such as asymmetric key
pairs and shared secrets are required. Due to the nature of these cryptographic primitives, there is
a requirement for the distribution or creation of files unique to a specific server, such that no
other server has access to those files. Examples of this are private keys, and threshold key
shares, although other non-cryptographic unique files may also become necessary over time.

In order to satisfy the above requirements of building and deploying a complex distributed system
consisting of unique, private files, two CLI tools have been created:

  . link:src/bin/omicron-package.rs[omicron-package] - build, package, install on local machine
  . link:src/bin/thing-flinger.rs[thing-flinger] - build, package, deploy to remote machines


If a user is working on their local illumos based machine, and only wants to run
omicron in single node mode, they should follow the install instruction in
the link:../README.adoc[Omicron README] and use `omicron-package`. If the user
wishes for a more complete workflow, where they can code on their local laptop,
use a remote build machine, and install to multiple machines for a more realistic
deployment, they should use `thing-flinger`.

The remainder of this document will describe a typical workflow for using
thing-flinger, pointing out room for improvement.

`thing-flinger` defines three types of nodes:

 * Client - Where a user typically edits their code and runs thing-flinger. This can run any OS.
 * Builder - A Helios box where Omicron is built and packaged
 * Deployed Server - Helios machines where Omicron will be installed and run

It's not at all necessary for these to be separate nodes. For example, a client and builder can be
the same machine, as long as it's a Helios box. Same goes for Builder and a deployment server. The
benefit of this separation though, is that it allows editing on something like a laptop, without
having to worry about setting up a development environment on an illumos based host.

Machine topology is configured in a `TOML` file that is passed on the command line. All illumos
machines are listed under `servers`, and just the names are used for configuring a builder and
deployment servers. An link:src/bin/deployment-example.toml[example] is provided.

Thing flinger works over SSH, and so the user must have the public key of their client configured
for their account on all servers. SSH agent forwarding is used to prevent the need for the keys of
the builder to also be on the other servers, thus minimizing needed server configuration.

== Typical Workflow

=== Prerequisites

Ensure you have an account on all illumos boxes, with the client public key in
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

.The build machine must have Rust and cargo installed, as well as
all the dependencies for Omicron installed. Following the *prerequisites* in the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/#build-and-run[Build and run] section of the main Omicron
README is probably a good idea.

=== Command Based Workflow

==== Build thing-flinger on client
`thing-flinger` is part of the `omicron-package` crate.

`cargo build -p omicron-package`

==== sync
Copy your source code to the builder. Note that this copies over your `.git` subdirectory on purpose so
that a branch can be configured for building with the `git_treeish` field in the toml `builder`
table.

`./target/debug/thing-flinger -c <CONFIG.toml> sync`

==== build-minimal
Build necessary parts of omicron on the builder, required for future use by thing-flinger.

`./target/debug/thing-flinger -c <CONFIG> build-minimal`

==== package 
Build and package omicron using `omicron-package` on the builder.

`./target/debug/thing-flinger -c <CONFIG> package`

==== overlay
Create files that are unique to each deployment server.

`./target/debug/thing-flinger -c <CONFIG> overlay`

==== install 
Install omicron to all machines, in parallel. This consists of copying the packaged omicron tarballs
along with overlay files, and omicron-package and its manifest to a `staging` directory on each
deployment server, and then running omicron-package, installing overlay files, and restarting
services.

`./target/debug/thing-flinger -c <CONFIG> install`

=== Current Limitations

`thing-flinger` is an early prototype. It has served so far to demonstrate that unique files,
specifically secret shares, can be created and distributed over ssh, and that omicron can be
installed remotely using `omicron-package`. It is not currently complete enough to fully test a
distributed omicron setup, as the underlying dependencies are not configured yet. Specifically,
`CockroachDB` and perhaps `Clickhouse`, need to be configured to run in multiple server mode. It's
anticipated that the `overlay` feature of `thing-flinger` can be used to generate and distribute
configs for this.

=== Design rationale

`thing-flinger` is a command line program written in rust. It was written this way to build upon
`omicron-package`, which is also in rust, as that is our default language of choice at Oxide.
`thing-flinger` is based around SSH, as that is the minimal viable requirement for a test tool such
as this. Additionally, it provides for the most straightforward implementation, and takes the least
effort to use securely. This particular implementation wraps the openssh ssh client via
`std::process::Command`, rather than using the `ssh2` crate, because ssh2, as a wrapper around
`libssh`, does not support agent-forwarding.
