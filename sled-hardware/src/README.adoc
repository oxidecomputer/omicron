= illumos hardware

This directory contains APIs for accessing information about the underlying
hardware of an illumos system. Some of these integrations rely on linking
against native illumos libraries, and therefore cannot be universally compiled
on all OSes.

As a consequence, this directory hierarchy is split into the "illumos" and
"non_illumos" targets. It's expected that the "non_illumos" target will remain
stub-only, but enable compilation (and code completion) on non-illumos editor
environments for the rest of the Sled Agent.
