/// A `RackSecret` is a shared secret used to perform a "rack-level" unlock.
///
/// Each server sled on an oxide rack contains up to 10 SSDs containing customer
/// data and oxide specific data. We want to ensure that if a small number of
/// disks or sleds get stolen, the data on them remains inaccessible to the
/// thief.  We also want to ensure that successfully rebooting a sled or an
/// entire rack does not require administrator intervention such as entering a
/// password.
///
/// To provide the above guarantees we must ensure that all disks are encrypted,
/// and that there is an automatic mechanism to retrieve the decryption key.
/// Furthermore, we must guarantee that the the key retrieval mechanism is not
/// available when a only a subset of sleds or disks from a rack are available
/// to an attacker. The mechanism we use to provide these guarantees is based on
/// <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing>. A threshold secret
/// is generated of which individual disk encryption keys are derived, and each
/// of `N` server sleds receives one share of the secret. `K` of these shares
/// must be combined in order to reconstruct the shared secret such that disks
/// may be decrypted. If fewer than `K` shares are available, no information
/// about the secret may be recovered, and the disks cannot be decrypted. We
/// call the threshold secret the `rack secret`.
///
/// Inside a rack then, the sleds cooperate over secure channels in order to
/// retrieve key shares and reconstruct the `rack secret`, the resulting derived
/// encryption keys, and unlock their own local storage. We call this procedure
/// `rack unlock`. The establishment of secure channels and the ability to trust
/// the validity of a participating peer is outside the scope of this particular
/// type and orthogonal to its implementation.
