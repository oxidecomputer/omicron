-- Sets up a trigger for the given table to automatically set a column called
-- `updated_at` whenever the row is modified (unless `updated_at` was included
-- in the modified columns)
--
-- # Example
--
-- ```sql
-- CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW());
--
-- SELECT diesel_manage_updated_at('users');
-- ```

-- had to replace generated contents with this because it contained syntax CRDB didn't like
SELECT 1;
