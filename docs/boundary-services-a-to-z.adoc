= Boundary Services A-Z

This document describes how to run an environment with boundary services.
It's a quick rundown and assumes knowledge of the basic setup described in the
Running Omicron (Non-Simulated) document.

== 0. Download SoftNPU ASIC emulator machinery

Grab the SoftNPU (ASIC simulator, scadm, P4 program, etc.) from CI:

----
./tools/ci_download_softnpu_machinery
----

(By default `install_runner_prerequisites.sh` will take care of running
`ci_download_softnpu_machinery` for you.)

== 1. Setup virtual hardware

----
PHYSICAL_LINK=<wan interface> pfexec ./tools/create_virtual_hardware.sh
----
Note that the `PHYSICAL_LINK` environment variable is optional. If not supplied,
the first link in `dladm show-phys` will be used.

The virtual hardware is a bit different than what has previously been used. What
we now have looks like this.

The `softnpu` zone will be configured and launched during the `create_virtual_hardware.sh`
script.

== 2. Build and install the control plane.

----
./tools/create_self_signed_cert.sh

cargo build --release --bin omicron-package
./target/release/omicron-package -t <target_name> target create -i standard -m non-gimlet -s softnpu
./target/release/omicron-package package
pfexec ./target/release/omicron-package install
----

The control plane is now starting, reference the Running Omicron (Non-Simulated)
doc for more details on determining when things are ready to go.

Once the control plane is running, `softnpu` can be configured via `dendrite`
using the `swadm` binary located in the `oxz_switch` zone.
An example script is provided in `tools/scrimlet/softnpu-init.sh`.
This script should work without modification for basic development setups,
but feel free to tweak it as needed.

----

== 4. Populating the system

Follow the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/docs/how-to-run.adoc[how-to-run.adoc]
to set up IPs, images, disks, instances etc. Things to pay particular attention
to here are the following.

- The address range in the IP pool should be on a subnet in your local network that
  can NAT out to the Internet.
- Be sure to set up an external IP for the instance you create.

You will need to set up `proxy-arp` if your VM external IP addresses are on the
same L2 network as the router or other non-oxide hosts:
----
pfexec /opt/oxide/softnpu/stuff/scadm \
  --server /opt/oxide/softnpu/stuff/server \
  --client /opt/oxide/softnpu/stuff/client \
  standalone \
  add-proxy-arp \
  $ip_pool_start \
  $ip_pool_end \
  $softnpu_mac
----

== 5. Configuring scrimlet/sidecar

A this point we have an instance up and running with external connectivity
configured via boundary services:
