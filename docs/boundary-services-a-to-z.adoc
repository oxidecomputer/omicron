= Boundary Services A-Z

This document describes how to run a RAP environment with boundary services.
It's a quick rundown and assumes knowledge of the basic setup described in the
Running Omicron (Non-Simulated) document.

Since we're using virtual network hardware, the OPTE hack is no longer needed.
The hack will automatically be disabled during the `create_virtual_hardware.sh`
script.

== 0. Install softnpu ASIC emulator machinery

----
./tools/install_softnpu_machinery.sh
----

== 1. Setup virtual hardware

----
PHYSICAL_LINK=<wan interface> pfexec ./tools/create_virtual_hardware.sh
----
Note that the `PHYSICAL_LINK` environment variable is optional. If not supplied,
the first link in `dladm show-phys` will be used.

The virtual hardware is a bit different than what's currently being used. What
we'll eventually wind up with looks like this.

The `softnpu` zone will be configured and launched during the `create_virtual_hardware.sh`
script.

== 2. Build and install the control plane.

----
./tools/create_self_signed_cert.sh

cargo build --release --bin omicron-package
./target/release/omicron-package -t switch_variant=softnpu package
pfexec ./target/release/omicron-package -t switch_variant=softnpu install
----

The control plane is now starting, reference the Running Omicron (Non-Simulated)
doc for more details on determining when things are ready to go.

Once the control plane is running, `softnpu` can be configured via `dendrite`
using `swadm`. An example script is provided in `tools/scrimlet/softnpu-init.sh`.
This script should work without modification for basic development setups,
but feel free to tweak it as needed.

== 4. Populating the system

Follow the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/meta/blob/master/engineering/remote-access-preview-demo-setup.adoc#setting-up-the-cli[RAP document]
to set up IPs, images, disks, instances etc. Things to pay particular attention
to here are the following.

- The address range in the IP pool should be on a subnet in your local network that
  can NAT out to the Internet.
- Be sure to set up an external IP for the instance you create.
- You will need to set up `proxy-arp` if your VM external IP addresses are on the
  same L2 network as the router or other non-oxide hosts.

Once your host has been populated with images, you can use the script at
`tools/quickstart.sh` to quickly create a VM and set up the `proxy-arp`. Please
be sure to edit the `ip_pool_start` and `ip_pool_end` variables to match your
desired address ranges.

== 5. Configuring scrimlet/sidecar

A this point we have an instance up and running. At the time of writing there is
not control plane driven boundary services automation so we're going to
configure the scrimlet by hand.

First we need to collect some information. In particular we need to know about
the virtual network our instance is sitting on. We can get that info from
`opteadm`.

....
pfexec /opt/oxide/opte/bin/opteadm dump-v2p

Virtual to Physical Mappings
======================================================================

VPC 15103089
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IPv4 mappings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
VPC IP                   VPC MAC ADDR      UNDERLAY IP
172.30.0.5               A8:40:25:F2:84:3F fd00:1122:3344:101::1

IPv6 mappings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
VPC IP                   VPC MAC ADDR      UNDERLAY IP
....

The key pieces of information we need here are the following. Please note these
will vary from instance to instance.

1. The VNI = `15103089`
2. The MAC = `A8:40:25:F2:84:3F`
3. The underlay = `fd00:1122:3344:101::1`

We also need to know what external IP has been assigned to our instance. The
only way I know how to do this right now is by looking at the web console. Go to
the instances page and navigate to the network tab. You'll see an External IP
field in the table. Let's assume that is `10.100.0.6` for this example.

Now we need to go tell boundary services about this information.

This can be accomplished via the following `swadm` command:

----
./out/softnpu/swadm -h "[fd00:1122:3344:101::2]" nat add \
    -e 10.100.0.6 \
    -l 1024 \
    -h 65535 \
    -i fd00:1122:3344:101::1 \
    -m A8:40:25:F2:84:3F \
    -v 15103089
