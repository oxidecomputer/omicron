NOTE: The instructions for _deploying_ SoftNPU with Omicron have been folded into xref:how-to-run.adoc[the main how-to-run docs].

The virtual hardware making up SoftNPU is a bit different than what was previously used. What we now have looks like this.

image::plumbing.png[]

The `softnpu` zone will be configured and launched during the `create_virtual_hardware.sh` script.

Once the control plane is running, `softnpu` can be configured via `dendrite`
using the `swadm` binary located in the `oxz_switch` zone.
An example script is provided in `tools/scrimlet/softnpu-init.sh`.
This script should work without modification for basic development setups,
but feel free to tweak it as needed.

While following
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/docs/how-to-run.adoc[how-to-run.adoc]
to set up IPs, images, disks, instances etc, pay particular attention to the
following.

- The address range in the IP pool should be on a subnet in your local network that
  can NAT out to the Internet.
- Be sure to set up an external IP for the instance you create.

You will need to set up `proxy-arp` if your VM external IP addresses are on the
same L2 network as the router or other non-oxide hosts:
----
pfexec /opt/oxide/softnpu/stuff/scadm \
  --server /opt/oxide/softnpu/stuff/server \
  --client /opt/oxide/softnpu/stuff/client \
  standalone \
  add-proxy-arp \
  $ip_pool_start \
  $ip_pool_end \
  $softnpu_mac
----

By the end, we have an instance up and running with external connectivity
configured via boundary services:
