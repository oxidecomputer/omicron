= Adding an Endpoint to Nexus

Adding new endpoints cuts across many concepts in Nexus, from the HTTP
interface, authorization, the database, and several tests. This guide
attempts to act as a "check-list" when adding new resources.

NOTE: This guide is not intended to be exhaustive, or even particularly
detailed. For that, refer to the documentation which exists in the codebase --
this document should act as a jumping-off point.

=== **HTTP**
* Add endpoints for either the internal or external API
** xref:../nexus/src/external_api/http_entrypoints.rs[The External API] is customer-facing, and provides interfaces for both developers and operators
** xref:../nexus/src/internal_api/http_entrypoints.rs[The Internal API] is internal, and provides interfaces for services on the Oxide rack (such as the Sled Agent) to call
** Register endpoints in the `register_endpoints` method (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/external_api/http_entrypoints.rs#L84[Example])
** These endpoints typically call into the *Application* layer, and do not access the database directly
* Inputs and Outputs
** Input parameters are defined in xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/nexus/types/src/external_api/params.rs[params.rs] (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/types/src/external_api/params.rs#L587-L601[Example])
** Output views are defined in xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/nexus/types/src/external_api/views.rs[views.rs] (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/types/src/external_api/views.rs#L270-L274[Example])

=== **Lookup & Authorization**
* Declare a new resource-to-be-looked-up via `lookup_resource!` in xref:../nexus/src/db/lookup.rs[lookup.rs] (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/db/lookup.rs#L557-L564[Example])
** This defines a new struct named after your resource, with some xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/db-macros/src/lookup.rs#L521-L628[auto-generated methods], including `lookup_for` (look up the authz object), `fetch_for` (look up and return the object), and more
* Add helper functions to `LookupPath` to make it possible to fetch the resource by either UUID or name (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/db/lookup.rs#L225-L237[Example])
** These are often named `pub fn <my_resource>_name`, or `pub fn <my_resource>_id`
* Use the xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/nexus/authz-macros/src/lib.rs[`authz_resource!` macro] to define a new `authz::...` structure, which is returned from the **Lookup** functions (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/authz/api_resources.rs#L758-L764[Example])
** If you define `polar_snippet = InProject` (for developer resources) or `polar_snippet = FleetChild` (for operator resources), most of the polar policy is automatically defined for you
** If you define `polar_snippet = Custom`, you should edit the omicron.polar file to describe the authorization policy for your object (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/authz/omicron.polar#L376-L393[Example])
* Either way, you should add reference the new resource when xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/authz/oso_generic.rs#L119-L148[constructing the Oso structure]

=== **Application**
* Add any "business logic" for the resource to xref:../nexus/src/app[the app directory]
* This layer bridges the gap between the database and external services.
* If your application logic involes any multi-step operations which would be interrupted by Nexus stopping mid-execution (due to reboot, crash, failure, etc), it is recommended to use a xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/tree/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/app/sagas[saga] to define the operations durably.

=== **Database**
* `CREATE TABLE` for the resource in xref:../common/src/sql/dbinit.sql[dbinit.sql] (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/common/src/sql/dbinit.sql#L1103-L1129[Example])
* Add an equivalent schema for the resource in xref:../nexus/db-model/src/schema.rs[schema.rs], which allows xref:https://docs.diesel.rs/master/diesel/index.html[Diesel] to translate raw SQL to rust queries (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/db-model/src/schema.rs#L144-L155[Example])
* Add a Rust representation of the database object to xref:../nexus/db-model/src[the DB model] (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/db-model/src/ip_pool.rs#L24-L40[Example])
** Remember to make the object visible; this is usually defined in xref:../nexus/db-model/src/lib.rs[lib.rs] (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/db-model/src/lib.rs#L102[Example]).
* Methods to send queries to the database are defined as part of the xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/tree/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/db/datastore[datastore] structure (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/db/datastore/ip_pool.rs[Example])

=== **Testing**

* Authorization
** There exists a xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/nexus/src/authz/policy_test[policy test] which compares all Oso objects against an expected policy. New resources are usually added to xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/nexus/src/authz/policy_test/resources.rs[resources.rs] to get coverage.
* openapi
** Nexus generates a new openapi spec from the dropshot endpoints. If you modify endpoints, you'll usually need to `EXPECTORATE=overwrite cargo test` the following targets...
*** External API: `test_nexus_openapi`
*** Internal API: `test_nexus_openapi_internal`
* Integration Tests
** Nexus' xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/tree/main/nexus/tests/integration_tests[integration tests] are used to cross the HTTP interface for testing. Typically, one file is used "per-resource".
*** These tests use a simulated Sled Agent, and keep the "Nexus" object in-process, so it can still be accessed and modified for invasive testing.
* Saga Tests
** Sagas are implictly tested through most integration tests, but they are also subject to more scrutiny, since they must fulfill certain properties (such as idempotency and an ability to unwind). These properties are typically tested in the same file as the saga definition (xref:https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/1dfe47c1b3122bc4f32a9c517cb31b1600581ea2/nexus/src/app/sagas/instance_create.rs#L963[Example])
