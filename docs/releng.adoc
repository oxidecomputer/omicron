= Oxide Release Engineering

Omicron is the Oxide control plane, and thus brings together all of the
various components outside of this repo that make up the software on the
product. This includes (but definitely isn't limited to):

- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/propolis[Propolis], our hypervisor
- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/helios[Helios], our host operating
  system
- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/crucible[Crucible], our block storage
  service
- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/maghemite[Maghemite], our switch
  control software and routing protocol
- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris[Hubris], our embedded
  microcontroller operating system used on the root of trust and service
  processors
- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/console[The web console]

Each of these has their own build processes that produce some sort of
usable artifact, whether that is an illumos zone or a tarball of static
assets.

The release engineering process builds the control plane and combines
it with the many external artifacts into a final artifact -- a Zip
archive of a TUF repository -- that contains everything necessary for
the product to operate. This process is run on each commit to ensure it
is always functional. You can also run the process locally with
`cargo xtask releng`.

== Process overview

`cargo xtask releng` performs all of these steps in parallel (with
the temporary exception of artifact downloads handled by
`tools/install_builder_prerequisites.sh`):

. `tools/install_builder_prerequisites.sh` downloads several artifacts
  (via the `tools/ci_*` scripts) that are necessary to build Omicron;
  many of these are ultimately packaged by `omicron-package`. These
  scripts are generally controlled by the `tools/*_version` and
  `tools/*_checksums` files.
. `cargo xtask releng` downloads the current root of trust and
  service processor images built by the Hubris release engineering
  process, which are signed in https://github.com/oxidecomputer/permission-slip[Permission Slip].
  This is controlled by the `tools/permslip_production` and
  `tools/permslip_staging` files.
. `omicron-package` is the heart of the release engineering process; it
  reads the manifest from `package-manifest.toml`, runs an appropriate
  `cargo build` command, downloads any additional artifacts, and
  packages them into a series of illumos zones and tarballs. (It can
  also manage installation and uninstallation of these zones; see
  how-to-run.adoc.)
. Some of the illumos zones are distributed with the OS images (because
  they are reliant on OS-specific APIs), and some are distributed
  separately. `cargo xtask releng` unpacks the zones for the OS image
  into a temporary directory that is overlaid onto the OS image in the
  next step.
. `helios-build` from the https://github.com/oxidecomputer/helios[Helios]
  repository then builds two images: the *host* image, which is used
  during normal operation, and the *trampoline* (or *recovery*) image,
  which is used to update the host image.
. Finally, `cargo xtask releng` generates a Zip archive of a
  https://theupdateframework.io/[TUF] repository, which contains the
  host and trampoline OS images, the ROT and SP images, and all the
  illumos zones that are not installed into the OS images. This archive
  can be uploaded to Wicket to perform an upgrade of the rack while the
  control plane is not running.

== Beyond `cargo xtask releng`

Currently we use TUF repos generated in CI (by `cargo xtask releng`)
directly. These repositories use a generated throwaway key to sign
the TUF metadata. In the limit, we will have a process to sign release
builds of these TUF repositories, which will be available as a Zip
archive for an operator to upload to Nexus or Wicket, as well as an
HTTPS repository for racks connected to the internet or with access to
a proxy to perform automatic updates. The exact nature of the PKI and
trust policies for each of these update flows is under discussion.
