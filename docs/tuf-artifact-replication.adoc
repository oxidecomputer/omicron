= TUF Artifact Replication (a.k.a. TUF Repo Depot)

The final output of our release process is a TUF repo consisting of all
of the artifacts the product requires to run. For the update system to
work, it needs access to those artifacts. There are some constraining
factors:

* Nexus is the only way into the system for these artifacts (either
  through direct upload from an operator, or a download initiated by
  Nexus to a service outside of the system).
* Nexus has no persistent local storage, nor can it directly use the
  artifacts (OS and zone images, firmware, etc.) even if it did store
  them.
* Sled Agent is generally what will directly use the artifacts (except
  for SP and ROT images, which MGS needs), and it can also manage its
  own local storage.

Thus Nexus needs to accept artifacts from outside of the system and
immediately offload them to individual Sled Agents for persistent
storage and later use.

We have chosen (see <<rfd424>>) the simplest possible implementation:
every Sled Agent stores a copy of every artifact on each of its M.2
devices. This is storage inefficient but means that a Sled Agent can
directly use those resources to create zones from updated images,
install an updated OS, or manage the installation of updates on other
components, without Nexus having to ensure that it distributed an
artifact to a sled _before_ telling it to use it. A Nexus background
task periodically ensures that all sleds have all artifacts.

== Sled Agent implementation

Sled Agent stores artifacts as a content-addressed store on an *update*
dataset on each M.2 device: the file name of each stored artifact is its
SHA-256 hash.

It also stores an _artifact configuration_ in memory: a list of all
artifact hashes that the sled should store, and a generation number.
The generation number is owned by Nexus, which increments the generation
number when the set of TUF repos on the system changes. Sled Agent
prevents modifying the configuration without an increase in the
generation number.

Sled Agent offers the following APIs on the underlay network, intended
for Nexus:

* `artifact_config_get`: Get the current artifact configuration.
* `artifact_config_put`: Put the artifact configuration that should be
  in effect. This API is idempotent (putting the same configuration does
  not change anything). Modified configurations must also increase the
  generation number.
* `artifact_list`: List the artifacts present in the artifact
  configuration along with the count of available copies of each
  artifact across the *update* datasets. Also includes the current
  generation number.
* `artifact_put`: Put the request body into the artifact store.
  Rejects the request if the artifact does not belong to the current
  configuration.
* `artifact_copy_from_depot`: Sends a request to another Sled Agent (via
  the *TUF Repo Depot API*; see below) to fetch an artifact. The base
  URL for the source sled is chosen by the requester. This API responds
  after a successful HTTP response from the source sled and the copy
  proceeds asynchronously. Rejects the request if the artifact does not
  belong to the current configuration.

Sled Agent also spawns another Dropshot API server called the *TUF Repo
Depot API* which offers one API on the underlay network, intended for
other Sled Agents:

* `artifact_get_by_sha256`: Get the content of an artifact.

In an asynchronous task called the _delete reconciler_, Sled Agent
periodically scans the *update* datasets for artifacts that are not
part of the present configuration and deletes them. Prior to each
filesystem operation the task checks the configuration for presence of
that artifact hash. The delete reconciler then waits for an artifact
configuration change until running again.

== Nexus implementation

Nexus has a `tuf_artifact_replication` background task which runs this
reliable persistent workflow:

1. Collect the artifact configuration (the list of artifact hashes, and
   the current generation number) from the database.
2. Call `artifact_config_put` on all sleds. Stop if any sled rejects the
   configuration (our information is already out of date).
3. Call `artifact_list` on all sleds. Stop if any sled informs us of a
   newer generation number.
4. Delete any local copies of repositories where all artifacts are
   sufficiently replicated across sleds. ("Sufficiently replicated"
   currently means that at least 3 sleds each have at least one copy.)
5. For any artifacts this Nexus has a local copy of, send `artifact_put`
   requests to N random sleds, where N is the number of puts required to
   sufficienty replicate the artifact.
6. Send `artifact_copy_from_depot` requests to all remaining sleds
   missing copies of an artifact. Nexus chooses the source sled randomly
   out of the list of sleds that have a copy of the artifact.

In each task execution, Nexus will attempt to do all possible work
that leads to every sled having a copy of the artifact. In the absence
of random I/O errors, a repository will be fully replicated across
all sleds in the system in the first execution, and the Nexus-local
copy of the repository will be deleted in the second execution.
`artifact_copy_from_depot` requests that require the presence of an
artifact on a sled that does not yet have it are scheduled after all
`artifact_put` requests complete.

== Preventing conflicts and loss of artifacts

The artifact configuration is used to prevent conflicts that may be
caused by two Nexus instances running the `tuf_artifact_replication`
background task simultaneously with different information. The worst
case scenario for a conflict is the total loss of an artifact across the
system, although there are lesser evils as well. This section describes
a number of possible faults and the mitigations taken.

=== Recently-uploaded repositories and artifact deletion

When Sled Agent receives an artifact configuration change, the delete
reconciler task begins scanning the *update* datasets for artifacts that
are no longer required and deletes them.

Nexus maintains its local copy of recently-uploaded repositories
until it confirms (via the `artifact_list` operation) that all of the
artifacts in the repository are sufficiently replicated (currently, at
least 3 sleds each have at least 1 copy).

If the `artifact_list` operation lists any artifacts that could be
deleted asynchronously, Nexus could incorrectly assume that an artifact
is sufficiently replicated when it is not. This could happen if a
repository is deleted, and another repository containing the same
artifact is uploaded while another Nexus is running the background task.

The artifact configuration is designed to mitigate this. The
`artifact_list` operation filters the list of artifacts to contain
only artifacts present in the current configuration. The delete
reconciler decides whether to delete a file by re-checking the current
configuration.

When Nexus receives the `artifact_list` response, it verifies that
the generation number reported is the same as the configuration it put
earlier in the same task execution. Because the response only contains
artifacts belonging to the current configuration, and that list of
artifacts is based on the same configuration Nexus believes is current,
it can trust that none of those artifacts are about to be deleted and
safely delete local copies of sufficiently-replicated artifacts.

=== Loss of all sleds with the only copy

There are two potential situations where we could lose the only copy of
an artifact. The first is a Nexus instance crashing or being replaced
before a local artifact can be put to any sleds. Crashes are difficult
to mitigate, as artifacts are currently stored in randomly-named
temporary directories that are non-trivial to recover on startup;
consequently there is no mitigation for this problem today. During
graceful removal of Nexus zones, a quiesced Nexus (see <<rfd459>> and
<<omicron5677>>) should remain alive until all local artifacts are
sufficiently replicated.

The second potential situation is a loss of all sleds that an artifact
is copied to after Nexus deletes its local copy. This is mostly
mitigated by Nexus attempting to fully replicate all artifacts onto
all sleds in every execution of the background task; if there are no
I/O errors, it only takes one task execution to ensure a repository is
present across the entire system.

=== Unnecessary work

`artifact_put` and `artifact_copy_from_depot` requests include the
current generation as a query string parameter. If the generation does
not match the current configuration, or the artifact is not present in
the configuration, Sled Agent rejects the request.
