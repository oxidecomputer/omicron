//! Dropshot-configurable DNS server
//!
//! This crate provides a standalone program that runs a UDP-based DNS server
//! along with a Dropshot server for configuring the records served over DNS.
//! The following RFDs describe the overall design of this server and how it's
//! used:
//!
//!   RFD 248 Omicron service discovery: server side
//!   RFD 357 External DNS in the MVP
//!   RFD 367 DNS propagation in Omicron
//!
//! Here are the highlights:
//!
//! (1) This component is used for both internal and external DNS in Omicron
//!     (the control plane for the Oxide system).  These are deployed
//!     separately.  A given instance is either an internal DNS server or an
//!     external one, not both.
//!
//! (2) For the internal DNS use case, it's absolutely essential that the DNS
//!     servers have no external dependencies.  That's why we persistently store
//!     a copy of the DNS data.  After a cold start of the whole Oxide system,
//!     the DNS servers must be able to come up and serve DNS so that the rest of
//!     the control plane components and locate each other.  The internal DNS use
//!     case is expected to be a fairly small amount of data, updated fairly
//!     infrequently, and not particularly latency-sensitive.
//!
//! (3) External DNS is required for availability of user-facing services like
//!     the web console and API for the Oxide system.   Eventually, these will
//!     also provide names for user resources like Instances.  As a result,
//!     there could be a fair bit of data and it may be updated fairly
//!     frequently.
//!
//! This crate provides three main pieces for running the DNS server program:
//!
//! 1. Persistent [`storage::Store`] of DNS data
//! 2. A [`dns_server::Server`], that serves data from a `storage::Store` out
//!    over the DNS protocol
//! 3. A Dropshot server that serves HTTP endpoints for reading and modifying
//!    the persistent DNS data
