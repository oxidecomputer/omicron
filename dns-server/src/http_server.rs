//! Dropshot server for configuring DNS namespace

// Shape of the API
// ------------------------------
//
// The DNS configuration API has just two endpoints: PUT and GET of the entire
// DNS configuration.  This is pretty anti-REST.  But it's important to think
// about how this server fits into the rest of the system.  When changes are
// made to DNS data, they're grouped together and assigned a monotonically
// increasing generation number.  The DNS data is first stored into CockroachDB
// and then propagated from a distributed fleet of Nexus instances to a
// distributed fleet of these DNS servers.  If we accepted individual updates to
// DNS names, then propagating a particular change would be non-atomic, and
// Nexus would have to do a lot more work to ensure (1) that all changes were
// propagated (even if it crashes) and (2) that they were propagated in the
// correct order (even if two Nexus instances concurrently propagate separate
// changes).
//
// This DNS server supports hosting multiple zones.  We could imagine supporting
// separate endpoints to update the DNS data for a particular zone.  That feels
// nicer (although it's not clear what it would buy us).  But as with updates to
// multiple names, Nexus's job is potentially much easier if the entire state
// for all zones is updated at once.  (Otherwise, imagine how Nexus would
// implement _renaming_ one zone to another without loss of service.  With
// a combined endpoint and generation number for all zones, all that's necessary
// is to configure a new zone with all the same names, and then remove the old
// zone later in another update.  That can be managed by the same mechanism in
// Nexus that manages regular name updates.  On the other hand, if there were
// separate endpoints with separate generation numbers, then Nexus has more to
// keep track of in order to do the rename safely.)
//
// See RFD 367 for more on DNS propagation.
//
//
// ETags and Conditional Requests
// ------------------------------
//
// It's idiomatic in HTTP use ETags and conditional requests to provide
// synchronization.  We could define an ETag to be just the current generation
// number of the server and honor standard `if-match` headers to fail requests
// where the generation number doesn't match what the client expects.  This
// would be fine, but it's rather annoying:
//
// (1) When the client wants to propagate generation X, the client would have
//     make an extra request just to fetch the current ETag, just so it can put
//     it into the conditional request.
//
// (2) If some other client changes the configuration in the meantime, the
//     conditional request would fail and the client would  have to take another
//     lap (fetching the current config and potentially making another
//     conditional PUT).
//
// (3) This approach would make synchronization opt-in.  If a client (or just
//     one errant code path) neglected to set the if-match header, we could do
//     the wrong thing and cause the system to come to rest with the wrong DNS
//     data.
//
// Since the semantics here are so simple (we only ever want to move the
// generation number forward), we don't bother with ETags or conditional
// requests.  Instead we have the server implement the behavior we want, which
// is that when a request comes in to update DNS data to generation X, the
// server replies with one of:
//
// (1) the update has been applied and the server is now running generation X
//     (client treats this as success)
//
// (2) the update was not applied because the server is already at generation X
//     (client treats this as success)
//
// (3) the update was not applied because the server is already at a newer
//     generation
//     (client probably starts the whole propagation process over because its
//     current view of the world is out of date)
//
// This way, the DNS data can never move backwards and the client only ever has
// to make one request.
//
//
// Concurrent updates
// ------------------
//
// Given that we've got just one API to update the all DNS zones, and given
// that might therefore take a minute for a large zone, and also that there may
// be multiple Nexus instances trying to do it at the same time, we need to
// think a bit about what should happen if two Nexus do try to do it at the same
// time.  Spoiler: we immediately fail any request to update the DNS data if
// there's already an update in progress.
//
// What else could we do?  We could queue the incoming request behind the
// in-progress one.  How large do we allow that queue to grow?  At some point
// we'll need to stop queueing them.  So why bother at all?
